1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We'll also tweak the hero-level encounters with gods to something that strikes a balance again, leaning towards a more epic feel,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
expand dungeons and temple relic hunting to facilitate more direction for demigod characters, and provide more healing options.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This all leads up to Myth and Magic.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
People who have been following Dwarf Fortress' development these many years will recall both the current cosmology of the game in these changes,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and perhaps wonder about the aspirations we have towards proceduralizing the entire setup,

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
including the existence of gods and how and whether magic works.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We're going to use this opportunity to set the stage for a new framework to be expanded upon in the future.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Siege improvements, investigations of villains, the ability to lead criminal networks, and other features were in the air before we made the transition to the premium version,

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and these are not forgotten either, and we'll be seeing about working on these after the initial Adventure Mode update, so stay tuned.
