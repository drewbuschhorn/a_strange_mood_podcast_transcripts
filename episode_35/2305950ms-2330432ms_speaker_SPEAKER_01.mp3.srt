00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
It's very drab. That's my big complaint about the graphics. It's verified on Steam Deck,

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,040
and the learning curve is kind of steep, but I played some on Steam Deck and it's been fine.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:11,520
Good.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,840
So, yeah, that's a nice plus. I might end up getting one of the expansions,

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,799
but I don't know which one. Maybe Ideology, because that sounds like fun.

6
00:00:20,799 --> 00:00:21,299
Yeah.

7
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:24,320
Well, you want to talk about Dwarf's Fortress some more?
