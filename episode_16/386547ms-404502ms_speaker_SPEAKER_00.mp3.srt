I think that's the right way to look at it and if you go to Bay12Games, the link in the show notes,

00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,240
you'll be able to read both the combat logs if you want to torture yourself

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,480
or the fun summaries that each of them have written about their fights

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,760
that I have cribbed shamelessly for this.
