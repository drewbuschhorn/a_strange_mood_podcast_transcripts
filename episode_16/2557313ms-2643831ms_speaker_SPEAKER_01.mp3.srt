1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,920
It's a star they will like. But it is much more magical in the sense of there is magic in the

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,080
world. I'm not saying that it's like a more enjoyable, wonderful game in a slangy way.

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:20,320
So you play a character that comes to a village to have a farm and you can fight monsters and mine

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,720
and date the people and everything. But in the character creation, there's a lot of customization.

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:35,360
You can play as an elf or a demon or an angel or an elemental. And everyone is very cute or

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
anime hot. So your romance choices are, they look like anime characters in the art style.

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,760
And the pests are baby dragons. It's so cute. And there's a big golden dragon who rules the city.

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,960
And for combat, you get spells as well as sword and crossbow and stuff. So I'm really enjoying

9
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,560
it in that it's really flexible in what your character's background is and what your special

10
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:10,720
skills are from your race and what your focus is. So like, I'm not really big into fishing in any of

11
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,960
these games. So I'm just, I've been able to completely ignore fishing. And I think it's

12
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,120
leveling passively because some quests will give me that regardless. It also has a multiplayer

13
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,320
function. So I will probably force you to play this even though you're not really into the starties.
