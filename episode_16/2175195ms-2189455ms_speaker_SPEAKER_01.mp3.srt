00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
I don't know, but the name The Itch of Puke made me go,

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:04,760
oh, why?

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,320
Because you don't have that much information

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,920
when you're just setting up the temples down.

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,460
So I had to go into legends mode and pull it out.

6
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,360
And I was quite charmed to find

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,120
that it was a bumblebee deity.
