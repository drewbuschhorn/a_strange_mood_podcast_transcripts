1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Yeah, I can't remember what it's called offhand, but it's not StoneSense.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,000
StoneSense is the thing.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,500
I should double-check that while we do the rest of this reporting, but yeah.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,000
And that I consider maybe a little bit cheating,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,500
just because it's really, really messing up the RNG, kind of, like the layer and all of that.

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:26,000
But, you know, it's hard to tell other people how to play their game.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I know in some games you have a lot of different complicated challenges that people do,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and we haven't seen a whole lot of that yet evolve for Dwarf Fortress, but I think it will.
