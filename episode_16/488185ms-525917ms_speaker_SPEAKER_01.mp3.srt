Yes. And that child is actually the only child in the fort. And I feel like last time I had

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,600
said something, maybe not on the episode, about we had had a baby born and parents were not married

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,560
and I must have either hallucinated this or they got married and I missed it. I don't know. But

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,040
also that child was an infant. And this one is a child, but it's only one year old. So it could

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:30,080
have aged up from infant to child. So they seemed to be thriving. They were both on the squadron,

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,960
which is how Irvaad was in Axe Dwarf. But I decided that I probably didn't want my

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,520
mayor to be on my squadron. I don't know.
