1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Yeah, you just do some gravel or something, you know.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Dwarves would know which stones are the softest and can be powdered.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You're rolling around in mica. I don't know.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yeah.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But the fact that, you know, there's a mod that would let you build beds out of stone,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I find it very hard to see that as, like, not being the spirit in which Dwarf Fortress was intended.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Whereas on the other hand, you know, you might have the mods that let you essentially build above ground or, you know, build forts as an elf or something like that.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That starts to seem like you're creeping away from what was intended.
