Okay, a metroidvania is a game where you progress get new items to unlock area to unlock

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,320
to unlock uh portions in areas that you've been to previously so you do a lot of backtracking

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,240
okay but also it's usually involves pretty creative problem solving with those um tools

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,680
that you get okay um so the classic obviously is metroid where you you know get one kind of power

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,280
up and that lets you double jump and so now you can get to this whole other set of areas and that

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,080
sort of thing yeah um and then castlevania some of the later castlevanias were that way as well

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:40,640
so they're called metroidvanias yeah um in this case it's interesting because it this game monster

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:48,320
sanctuary harkens back to a very very old nintendo game original nintendo game called a boy and his

9
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:57,680
blob which is where you would go around with as a titular boy with his blob and your blob would

10
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,440
change into different things depending on what kind of jelly bean you fed it
