like fungal wood flooring and it's all engraved and we've got some gold altars in there.

00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:11,440
So she shall be honored. But I have been thinking about this a lot because for a little while I was

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:19,120
not having fun with Wet-Ringed because we had had some reptile men appear and they didn't do a lot

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,840
of damage. They didn't kill anyone and then they went back into the water in our caverns and are

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,640
just chilling in the water. They weren't attacking anyone. They weren't moving. They were just

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:35,360
sitting under there burbling I guess. But I could not get my dwarves to do anything. Like I,

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,840
they would be going down the stairs and there was one point of the stairs that was fully enclosed

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,600
and they would cancel jobs because they spotted reptile men.
