00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
Not neck water. Neck water is only for sipping.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,280
Exactly. But we have not had any problems with Forgotten Beasts. None have shown up.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,680
Both of the ettins were above ground.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,320
Yeah.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,120
And we also have not had any problems so far with cavern dwellers.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,160
We have not had any problems with cavern dwellers.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,920
They don't seem to be showing up at this fort currently or else I just have us sealed up so

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,880
well. The only real ones have been some trolls and some other things previous episode.

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,400
So I don't know. How have you been doing with cavern dwellers?
