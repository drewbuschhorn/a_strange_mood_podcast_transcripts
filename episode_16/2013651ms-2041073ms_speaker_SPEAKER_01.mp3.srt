00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Yeah, that would be really cool. And it would be fun on my side, where I'm like, looking at all

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,120
the stories and things that develop to see how their relationships grow and change. And if they

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:15,920
just end up in like a giant polyamorous relationship. Because, well, I mean, that

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,680
doesn't happen on on long journeys, you see couples form or throuples or whatever, but

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,240
you never see. No, I'm not gonna say never, because I'm pretty sure that I've seen someone

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,280
say that they had.
