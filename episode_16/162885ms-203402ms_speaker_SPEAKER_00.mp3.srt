1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
Exactly. The last bit of housekeeping I wanted to cover, I'll talk for a little bit about,

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:12,400
which is the state of the gladiator competition. You'll remember that in our last episode we

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:19,280
invited you to go to Bay 12 Games, look for the Dwarf Fortress 8th Annual, I think,

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:26,480
something like that, gladiator contest and submit some gladiators. Some of you did and we've had

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,800
enough people there that they've started the game. It's ongoing, the betting ring is open,

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,720
so if you go to the link in the show notes you can actually put bets on the second round,

7
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,320
the first round has already passed.
