1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
It is, kind of.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,440
We haven't had too many interesting objects created.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,520
We've got a 12,000 dwarf bucks platinum crown

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,440
called Skinny Flay, the Contingent Law,

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,860
which has almost nothing interesting about it.

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,360
It is just a-

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,520
It's just made of platinum.

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,920
Yeah, not even encrusted with any gems,

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,080
though we have a lot of gems sitting around.

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,080
And then the other object I enjoyed was a 4,000 dwarf buck.
