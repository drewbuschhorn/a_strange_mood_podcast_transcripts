00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
sea creatures in there. I discovered that in order to catch the sea creatures they don't

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,360
just run out and catch them with their hands when you tell them to catch a live fish sea

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,360
creature. Yeah. Instead you need to have an animal trap and they'll take the animal trap,

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,720
put the animal trap down until they catch something and take it back and then they'll

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,920
come and put that into the aquarium. Fair enough. But I'm having fun with that. I'm

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,440
going to work on building that out. They seem to get some pleasant moods walking by the

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:35,440
high quality aquarium and also I have it set so every aquarium also they make a window and

8
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:42,320
I've been putting the windows around just to increase the values. So no my glass industry

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:42,800
is going well.
