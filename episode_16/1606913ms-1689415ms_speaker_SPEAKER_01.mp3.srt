1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,540
I think it, I mean, it might exist

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:02,860
and we just don't know about it.

3
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,460
Like embark with no animals or something like that.

4
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,300
Like those kinds of things.

5
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,420
So part of what I'm thinking of with this is with the Sims

6
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,460
and people have over the years come up with all kinds

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,860
of like just crazy challenges.

8
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,920
So like, so a Sim that never leaves the lot

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,320
which would be really challenging

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,660
because you need money and stuff.

11
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,700
Or I remember back in the day it got spread around

12
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,060
that I think it was Rosebud

13
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,380
was the just automatic get a million Gill

14
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,500
and there was mother load for a lot more than that.

15
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,260
And sometimes we just, we being me and my, you know

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,900
other teenage friends would just do that

17
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,460
so that we could design fancy houses

18
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,340
and our Sims could have all of the cool stuff

19
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,180
and all of that.

20
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,720
But I mean, it is a cheat, I guess, you know

21
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,380
you have to bring up the cheat code ability

22
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,700
but at the same time, some of these other challenges

23
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,780
that would be genuinely challenging require you

24
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,780
to choose traits or raise your Sims in such a way

25
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,900
that it causes a challenge.

26
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,860
So like telling, preventing Sim parents

27
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,020
from interacting with their children beyond like enough

28
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,020
to keep Sims Child Protective Services

29
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,460
from coming and taking the child away.

30
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,860
And then you have this like.
