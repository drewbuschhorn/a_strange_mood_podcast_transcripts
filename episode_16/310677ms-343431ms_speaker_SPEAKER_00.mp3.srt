Alright, and then the third one was, the third most bet on one, was Marmota Monax,

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,840

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,400
Marmota was a groundhog man who stood in his side of the arena with a bloodstained

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,560
black bronze pickaxe. The beast was a hellish minotaur with nothing more than a copper shield.

00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,760
The shield was, um, the minotaur jammed his shield between

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,560
Marmota's ribs, milling them to paste, resulting in Marmota's death.
