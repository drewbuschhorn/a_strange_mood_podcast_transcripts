Other people do start new worlds every time and all that.

00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:11,020
For this world, I have looked in Legends mode and found that some of my previous forts eventually

00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,420
did get the Monarch moving there.

00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,900
So it's sort of like I'm setting up the fort into good quality and then moving on and they

00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,260
sort of follow behind me.
