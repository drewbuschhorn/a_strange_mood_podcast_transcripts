1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
In this one, your various creatures, as you capture them,

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,120
they can each be kind of equipped individually

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,280
when you're out in the world, as opposed to fighting.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,800
And they will do different things

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,000
to let you get to new regions.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,160
You got that a little bit in Pokemon as well,

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,560
but this is more focused directly on that.

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,400
So you start out, well, I chose a bird to start out with,

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,800
and so I can fly around holding onto it.

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,600
And I've gotten a sword cat knight type thing

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,480
that will chop down barriers for me.

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,280
Oh, cool.

13
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:36,840
So it's fun.

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,840
It doesn't require a whole lot of mental energy.

15
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,920
It's just kind of exploring an interesting world.
