Yeah, it's important, I think, to be able to do some of that, especially with what essentially

00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,300
amounts to trash mobs.

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,520
They're not named, they don't have anything interesting about them.

00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:19,040
It's nice to see that you have a certain amount of cavern dwellers, but just wave after wave

00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,760
to no purpose just, I think, kind of wastes time if you've got other things going on.
