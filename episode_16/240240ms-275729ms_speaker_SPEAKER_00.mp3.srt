00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Ah, the other fun notes from the first round of that competition.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Yeti, soon to become Spaghetti, was the first winner.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I chose the top three fighters based off the number of bets that were placed on their rounds.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So Yeti, soon to become Spaghetti, was the winner.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
His managers seemed to be a rather secretive bunch of dwarves from the north.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
He fought the human Peacock, a maritime mercenary there to support his village,

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
who was strangled by the Yeti.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Dark.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Dark!

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Dark!
