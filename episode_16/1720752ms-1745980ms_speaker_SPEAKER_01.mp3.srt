1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
So that sounds like actually kind of a fun challenge and something that could be actually

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,800
really aesthetically pleasing.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,440
If you're only going to make furniture out of like silver and blue stone or whatever

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,840
like that, that could be really, it would be really difficult, but you can make something

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,040
really cool and pretty at the end of it.

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,880
And I think that to some degree the challenges are just built in within the game, so like

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,040
settling in an icy biome or whatever.
