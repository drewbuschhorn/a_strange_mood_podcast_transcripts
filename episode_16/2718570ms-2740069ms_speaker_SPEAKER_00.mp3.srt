1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
Yeah, and that does really make the whole queer romance

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,360
question much simpler from a programming point of view

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,240
as well.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,160
I honestly think a lot of games that

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,560
winds up being part of the problem

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,160
is just figuring that out.

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,400
And with what I've seen in this game,

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,520
it seems to be very flexible and let's love be love.
