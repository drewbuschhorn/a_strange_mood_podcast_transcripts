1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Yeah. So still, still don't know what those are going to be, but, um,

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,520
excited to see. And, uh, we got our first forgotten beast this afternoon.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,680
This was, Kamaba has come, a towering feathered porcupine.

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,680
It has a knobby trunk and it undulates rhythmically.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,980
Its emerald feathers are downy. Beware its deadly spittle.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,720
And it actually had a really cute sprite. It did have a trunk.

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,480
It wasn't green. So we just have to envision it having green feathers.

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,600
So this guy came in and he was like, he was zooming along,

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,120
like looking for dwarves to murder. Um,

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,120
took out four dwarves was eventually killed once they sent the squadron down.

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,440
And there were some peasants fighting him who survived,

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,480
which is pretty impressive. But after killing him, finally,

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,160
I did as you did.

14
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,960
And I built a butcher right next to its carcass and the dwarves just auto

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,280
butchered it. And then I, um,

16
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,760
went to check on the tannery and it had Tana hide.

17
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:06,080
So, um, you said I should look and see what dwarf was hauling it just to make

18
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,080
sure. And we followed her along. She has very sad story,

19
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,480
but I'm not going to get derailed just yet. Uh,

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,320
so she made us some forgotten beast leather.

21
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,160
And now I am having someone sew a leather image of

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,320
that forgotten beast onto its own hide,

23
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,680
which I feel is fitting.

24
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,880
It's very metal.

25
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,400
That hasn't, I made the order, but it hasn't happened yet.

26
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:52,400
So I'm excited to see what comes of that.
