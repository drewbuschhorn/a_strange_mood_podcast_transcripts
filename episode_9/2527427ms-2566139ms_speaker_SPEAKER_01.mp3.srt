Yeah, well, fair enough. I'm glad they're enjoying it.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,680
Speaking of instruments, real quick, I forgot that the previous year I had requested just

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,420
one of every instrument from my civilization because I'm determined to get these dwarves

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,120
using the instruments. And when they showed up, there were so many types of instrument

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,160
that I was like, I'm never ever going to be able to afford this because I had told them

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,680
to haul the gem bins over. The gem bin numbers when I was selecting them, either my brain

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,600
or the number that I saw in that list was off by a zero. So we bought every instrument

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:51,360
they had. So hopefully my dwarves will start making some music.
