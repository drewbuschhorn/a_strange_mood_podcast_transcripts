1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
And I dug, and I dug, and I dug, and I didn't find the caverns.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,400
And I was extremely frustrated because so much dwarven industry really relies on being

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,400
in the caverns.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,200
Finally did hit them.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,120
It was a matter of just like opening out six tiles around the staircase in one place.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,480
But before that I was like digging out these giant spurs in all the cardinal directions

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,680
looking for the caverns.

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,480
But I guess the good news is that I now have that established to then put bedrooms and

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,480
stuff down there.
