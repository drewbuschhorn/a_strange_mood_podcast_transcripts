1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Which is... it's just, it's a terrible name.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,120
Rasput.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,120
Rasput.

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,120
Rasput.

5
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,120
Just say it like a Russian.

6
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,120
Rasput.

7
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,120
Rasput.

8
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,120
Um, hopefully we're not offending anyone.

9
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,880
Well, so yeah.

10
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,040
And then I had quite a few other logistical problems with this fort to the degree that

11
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,040
I was like, okay, this fort is broken and I'm just going to start a new one.

12
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,640
That ended up not being the case, but some of you probably saw this on stream.

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:35,240
I was feeling like a lot of time had passed without seeing merchants and I really needed

14
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,760
merchants because we need more dwarves, we need other stuff.

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,680
And I finally went and looked and the initial merchants traders from our civilization were

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,040
stuck on the map.

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:01:04,160
Like maybe 15 tiles, 20 tiles away from our trading post.
