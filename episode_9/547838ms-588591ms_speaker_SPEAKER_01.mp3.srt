1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
And this time I immediately went and saw where it was and put a hotkey there and I can go

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,800
back and find that and deal with that.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,800
You're so smart.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,800
I am so smart.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,720
I was really smart with doing this one.

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:18,720
Oh yeah, and speaking of my ghost that stole a gem, I'm trying to be organized and I have

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,520
like all of this in my head under the header of like dwarf logistics.

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,640
So the giant kias, keys?

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,640
Kias.

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,640
I don't know.

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,000
Anyway, the giant birds kept stealing our gemstones out of the trading post so I finally

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,720
moved it into the mountain and like smoothed out an entrance for traders to be able to

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,760
come and go and that has solved the problem.

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:58,720
No more bird theft.
