1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
But of course, you do have to put a drain in,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,840
as we've talked about before.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,240
So for that, I put down some grates

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,920
so the water would just kind of fall down,

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,480
and then dug down a couple of levels,

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:30,480
and then dug off the map and smoothed it out.
