1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
And some of their stuff was still at the trading post,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,140
and now that stuff is mine.

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,020
Then the next year, my civilization did not come back.

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:08,660
Fair enough.

5
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,740
They did come back the following year after that.

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,980
So still don't know what was up with that.

7
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,180
I'm assuming pathing, because it seems like any time I

8
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,700
have a problem with Thor Fortress, I can say,

9
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,100
oh, well, they're probably having trouble with the pathing.

10
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,080
And then I sound smart.
