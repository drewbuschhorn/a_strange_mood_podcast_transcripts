1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
No, no, that's relatively easy.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,240
And you've got to place that down in such a location

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,400
that one z-level below is water.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,200
The pump itself is now at, you know,

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,960
the z-level we're talking about is on land.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,240
And then the outlet of the pump

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,800
will have water pushed out there.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,840
So you're basically moving water up one z-level

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,840
and over kind of two squares.
