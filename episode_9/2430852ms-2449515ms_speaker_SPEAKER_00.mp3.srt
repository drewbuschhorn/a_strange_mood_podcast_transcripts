1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Yeah, there do seem to be a lot of different organs, either for...

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Organs.

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:10,000
Yeah, or, uh, or the first one I got, um, a bell organ, right?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yeah, yeah.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Because it had something like 65 bells of differing sizes that are played by a keyboard.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yeah.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm like, that's not a thing.
