Well, I later couldn't figure out why one of my dwarves in particular, his name is Dodoc,

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,320
was so cranky. And I finally looked him up and he's our bookkeeper. And I'm pretty sure I've

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,600
had an unhappy bookkeeper before. So maybe like that job just lends itself to being kind of grumpy.

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,640
I mean, I would probably be grumpy if I had to keep track of all the crap that they have in

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:30,080
their fort. But in looking at his character sheet, I saw that Dumid was Dodoc's lover.
