1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,340
I mean, that's just another example of how you got to bring your own fun.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,640
Absolutely.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:10,740
Uh, there has been an interview split into two parts on the Game Maker's

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,300
Notebook podcast with Zack and Tarn Adams.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,840
And one of the really noteworthy things that I thought that they said was that

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:22,800
they need these types of stories to be shared because this game is a community

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,520
experience.

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,080
And I thought that that was so cool and so evocative of what we do and why people

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,760
listen to us talk about our forts because like this craziness.

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,940
And if you don't have someone who understands, they're just going to look

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,620
at you like you are absolutely just batshit crazy.
