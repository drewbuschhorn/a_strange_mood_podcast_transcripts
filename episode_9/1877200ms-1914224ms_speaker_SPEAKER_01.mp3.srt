It just occurred to me that when I was looking at a dwarf who was unhappy, I think he was

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,440
a migrant, and I was looking through his memories and he had a lot and I was getting excited

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,360
because I think he came from one of my previous forts, but some of the positive memories were

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,240
learning about different trades.

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,000
And I'm wondering if having additional guild halls might also contribute to that.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,800
Because frequently you'll see that they'll be unhappy because they haven't practiced

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,720
a craft or something like that, and I'm wondering if that additional knowledge, like watching

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,000
a demonstration or listening to a talk or whatever, also might help.
