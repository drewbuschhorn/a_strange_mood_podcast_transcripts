floor. They're sitting on the floor and dwarves, I think that it was Sal that had done the

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,840
research on this, like they're more likely to take something if it's not in a bin. And

00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:16,120
she had done the experiment with hauling things to the trading post and you can just grab

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:21,640
all the loose stuff and move it. I haven't really done that. I just have it open by one

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:27,440
of the main staircases and I see goods come and go from there. So presumably dwarves are

00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:33,040
stealing things.
