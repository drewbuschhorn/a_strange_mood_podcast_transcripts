Unfortunately, when we were finishing off the building of that, I decided to wall things off to make sure that nobody accidentally slipped into the water pump area.

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And when I told them to build the walls, someone decided to have the bright idea of going down and retrieving a block that had gotten free in the construction process

00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and landed kind of down where I built a little, you know, cistern for the water to build up to be pumped out.

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And because of the pressure suction from the pump, they were pulled forward and died.
