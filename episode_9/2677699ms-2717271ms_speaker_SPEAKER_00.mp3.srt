That one we actually dealt with quite well because it actually got caught in a trap hallway I had set up

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:13,120
where I had doors on one end and the other end. It came up, I locked the door that it was trying

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,520
to get out of and then locked the door that it came up through and then I had carved out the

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,400
walls around it as fortifications. So I was able to have my marks dwarves walk over,

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,480
station them like right where they could see it in the, by the fortifications because you can

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,000
carve out the fortifications and they're like murder holes. And they just stood there and took

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
pot shots at it.
