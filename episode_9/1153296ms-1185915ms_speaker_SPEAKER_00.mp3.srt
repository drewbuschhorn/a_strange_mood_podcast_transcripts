1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
And then after that I was able to

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,680
Build my copper culvert. So just cop a line of copper walls

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,040
basically to

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,840
Two spaces wide I guess and then you know copper one wall of copper on each side

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,240
Have it go south then east and then back north again

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,120
right to the front of my

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,240
Entrance into my fort. Yeah, and then you just let it pour over
