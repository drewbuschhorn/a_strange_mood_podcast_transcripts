1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
which I'm not entirely... Yeah, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with that because I told

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,240
somebody to take it to the trash and they haven't really and I don't... They need like a bucket.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:15,600
Exactly. So that's been my Forgotten Beast experience there. And that's kind of a bit

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:23,520
where we're at in Fort Esteem Manors. Yeah. Or Copper Streams as I like to call it. I'm actually

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,080
pretty happy with this one. Interesting things are happening. The different dwarves are forming

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,360
relationships. Yeah. Overall I think I'm going to have more good stories out of Copper Streams.
