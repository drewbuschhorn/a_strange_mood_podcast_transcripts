1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
And so I made him statues of water buffalo out of this light blue stone.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,000
I put one in in his office and I gave him light blue furniture and I put light blue

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
flooring down in his room and another water buffalo statue and he's a little happier.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,480
He likes his bedroom a lot.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,480
Good.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,480
Yeah.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,600
And then the other thing that I did was because he has this whatever bookkeeping skill is

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:30,520
called I bumped him from doing very little of it to a lot of it.

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:35,440
And I don't know if that has helped or not but we have very precise calculations now.

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,200
So at any rate he's a little bit happier.

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,440
So do you do you know of any other ways like I have the open stockpile so that they can

12
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,600
take things if they want.

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,920
I need to explain that.

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,920
OK.

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,360
The idea between behind the open stockpile is that you make a finished goods stockpile

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,960
say stockpile one more time stockpile stockpile and you tell it not to allow bins.

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,960
And so things like bracelets rings crowns finished goods.

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:29,920
They're just don't.
