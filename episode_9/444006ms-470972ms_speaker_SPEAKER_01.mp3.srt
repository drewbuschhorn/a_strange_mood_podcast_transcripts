00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,240
So after digging all the spurs and everything, we found actually both the lower two caverns,

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:15,360
so like the dark blue-green moss and the purple moss. And then we found, we hadn't found the

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,400
magma yet, but there was some hot stone and I was like, okay, well, we'll just dig into that and

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:30,640
we'll hit magma eventually. We hit magma immediately and I saw a dwarf get incinerated.
