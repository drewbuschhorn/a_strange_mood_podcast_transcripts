1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
No, no, they don't go near that cistern.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:10,560
But if I start doing some pumping or trying to move water around, it will come from Dumed's

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,560
watery grave.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:18,840
So he, despite being cranky, never feels hatred toward anyone or anything, and he often acts

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,840
with compassion, a turnaround after his romance with Dumed in 124.

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,920
But he is conflicted by this, since he sees these tendencies as an impediment to his quest

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,400
for power.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,400
Power!

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,400
Yeah.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,600
He is also more shameless.

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:53,600
And less private.
