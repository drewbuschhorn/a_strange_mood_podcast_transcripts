Yeah, I have one more piece of housekeeping, which is that in our Facebook group, Lord Bookworm,

00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,720
I'm gonna go with his Twitch name just because I don't know how people feel about just reading out

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:17,040
their full name. I should have asked him. At any rate, he included a great artifact that was

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,760
generated in his world. I didn't want to include it kind of in the course of the podcast, so it

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,880
didn't seem too much like we were just taking his content. But I've made an image of it, but I want

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,200
to read it out here to you, which is, this is an amethyst coffin.
