1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Oh, there is a ton of meat. Yeah. So I think that that's gonna get cooked into our basic meals or whatever

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,960
We're eating now and we will dine on forgotten beast flesh

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:16,880
But she she I guess witnessed the this forgotten beast murdering for other dwarves

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,400
And it's traumatized from that and also traumatized from having a miscarriage. Oh

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,000
Which is so sad like oh my gosh, this is so real

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,960
So I'm gonna have to help her along. I'll adopt her and see what I can do for her

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,120
She's a fisher dwarf and we're not really fishing

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,140
So you think you're gonna have to learn a new trade or maybe we can start cave fishing. That's a thing, right? Yeah

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,140
Cave fishing. Yeah, we'll start her some cave fishing.
