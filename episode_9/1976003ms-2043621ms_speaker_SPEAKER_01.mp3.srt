1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
in a way.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Yeah.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,200
And I've talked about how I'm not sure how to make an aesthetically pleasing fort, especially

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,600
like on the larger scale is one thing, but when you start looking at individual dwarves

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,600
and their preferences and then making their bedrooms and things meet those desires, like

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,920
it starts to just naturally get prettier.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,920
I think so, yeah.

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:26,200
I also have a lot of colorful stone at this particular fort, so it's nice.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,840
I am glad I persisted because we have so many gems and pretty stone, and even though we

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,400
don't have a ton of like, we don't have silver or copper, best I can tell, or we haven't

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,320
found it yet, it's still very full of useful things and pretty things.

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,800
So I was thinking that I was going to just spend some time this afternoon working on

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,080
happiness, but then we got cavern dwellers.

14
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,400
We at least got the alert for them.

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,960
I never saw them.

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,680
They I guess never ventured into our part of the cavern, so I don't know what they are

17
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,400
yet even when I went to look at the sheet that has everybody who's at your fort and

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,560
the invaders.

19
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,840
So that's still a mystery.

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,520
I'm not sure what it's going to end up being.

21
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:24,520
I hope to see something different, you know?
