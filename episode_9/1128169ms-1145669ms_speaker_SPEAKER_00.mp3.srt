00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
So yeah, so I built two windmills next to each other so that they're power connected.

00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,000
Yeah.

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:14,500
Then I built one pump and built a little, you know, dug in a little channel into the side of the mountain

00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:30,500
so that the water would pump out and then be held in that channel.
