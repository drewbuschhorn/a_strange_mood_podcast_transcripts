00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,600
When rain hits a tile labeled as a murky pool, it will begin to fill up with 1 7th water,

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,940
and if that does not evaporate, the water will grow deeper until the pool is full.

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,840
Murky pools do not overflow from rain, and this extra water can be drained off and stored

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,840
or used.

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,080
While not much help, it can really help maps without unlimited water supplies such as river

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,760
or brook.
