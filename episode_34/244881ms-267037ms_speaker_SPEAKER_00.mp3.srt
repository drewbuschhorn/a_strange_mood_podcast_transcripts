00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I've been playing Kenshi a little bit.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What's that?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So that's the one Roland from Dwarf Fortress Roundtable mentioned it,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and other people have mentioned it before as well.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That one is you kind of play a post-apocalyptic RPG character

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
in a really fully realized 3D world.
