00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
Well, now I'm just thinking about Sanderson's Stormlight Archives.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,840
This is Brandon Sanderson, the fantasy writer, he has a series called Stormlight Archives

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:15,840
and their class system is based around eye color, so the upper cast is light-eyed and

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,040
the lower cast is dark-eyed.
