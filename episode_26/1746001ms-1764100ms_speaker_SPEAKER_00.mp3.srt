1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
but I had to look them up because I'd never seen one

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,200
and it kind of looks like the rainbow bright horse.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,960
So I thought it was pretty cute.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,160
So this is just quoting from the wiki.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,000
They are massive creatures who dwell

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,120
on the first and second underground layers.

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,480
They don't actively seek fights,

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,480
but are huge creatures about half the weight of an elephant.
