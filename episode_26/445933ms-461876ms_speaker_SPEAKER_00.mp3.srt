00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,480
Well, I made the world and then I went to settle and I realized that

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,680
it was just all really hot and tropical and it wasn't very interesting to me in

00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,280
terms of flora and fauna and everything. So I was

like, meh.
