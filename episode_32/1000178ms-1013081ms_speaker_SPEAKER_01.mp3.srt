1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
It happens on my harp.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,480
Um, I guess for those who don't know, I play a floor harp and with 40 strings

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,560
and, um, those, the strings ring, even if you don't touch them and they ring

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,880
until they stop vibrating, so.
