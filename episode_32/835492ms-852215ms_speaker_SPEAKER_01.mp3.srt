00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
And so I may have started war for nothing, I guess.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,480
I'm farming rutherers as well now.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,720
I mentioned that before.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,840
Yeah, we have a lot of them.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,040
So now they're trained enough to stay in the pasture and we're getting baby rutherers.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,680
None of the dwarves are adopting them as pets, I'm afraid.
