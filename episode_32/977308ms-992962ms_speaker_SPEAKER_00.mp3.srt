1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,040
OK.

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,160
And middle register, low pitch, heavy sonorous timbre.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,400
So anyway, the interesting thing to me

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,080
here was where it said that it has a string that

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,320
vibrates in sympathy.
