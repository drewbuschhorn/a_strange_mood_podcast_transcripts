1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
I wasn't able to find a good definition of that,

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,240
but I'm assuming it's something

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,660
where you intentionally pluck it

4
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,800
and then it keeps playing in the background.
