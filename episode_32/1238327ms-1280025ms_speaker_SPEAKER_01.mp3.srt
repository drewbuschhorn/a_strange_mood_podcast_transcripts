1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
On the item is an image of Eton Kegulfs, the dwarf,

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,640
and two guinea fowls in rose quartz.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,600
Eton Kegulfs is embracing the two guinea fowls.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,080
I did not look that up and I really regret that.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,760
I got so hung up on the next part

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,840
that I didn't look up the hugging the guinea fowls.

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,760
On the item is an image of Vadok Heldpaddles,

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,959
the dwarf in Morian.

9
00:00:22,959 --> 00:00:25,260
Vadok Heldpaddles is contemplating.

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,020
Their work relates to the possession

11
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,400
of the dwarf Vadok Heldpaddles in Bridgeward

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,240
in the midsummer of 102.

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,439
He was possessed and made a different artifact.

14
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:39,680
So I thought that was fun,

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,880
but Vadok is a chemist apparently.
