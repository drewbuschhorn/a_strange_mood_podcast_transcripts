00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
I'm a little bit at the point where I'm like,

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,040
ah, this place is really functioning pretty well

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,400
and doesn't need that much help from me.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,720
So maybe it's time for a new fort, but not yet.

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,080
So we are a city with a population of 137.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,720
And I left, I wrote myself the note that question mark

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,719
because some migrants were arriving

8
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:19,760
at the last time that I was playing.

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,520
And I need to make so, so many bedrooms.

10
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,559
There are so many dwarves sleeping in dormitories

11
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:26,160
and I feel kind of bad about it.
