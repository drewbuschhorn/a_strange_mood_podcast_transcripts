Hey, they said that if you're active, it doesn't matter how small you are, and we have like

00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,600

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,600
Ooh.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,600
Wow.

00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,600
That's a lot.

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,440
I think that if I actually streamed enough, that would be enough to monetize, but I don't

00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,120
stream that much.
