Yeah. So that looks awesome. Frostpunk 2 is going to come out at some point. I will play that one,

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,520
but it's going to be really low on my priority list, because I would rather play Against the

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:21,120
Storm. I mean, I never played Frostpunk again because I quit my run because I was a few days

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,000
out from the deadline or whatever, and I was very clearly going to lose. At the time, I was just

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,440
sunk a lot of hours into what's going to be a loss.
