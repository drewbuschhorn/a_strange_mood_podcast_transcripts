00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Actually, part of why I've been thinking about Adventure Mode is because I've been playing

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,720
kind of obsessively a game called Core Keeper, which you and I tried in early access like

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,920
six-ish months, a year ago?

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,920
I don't know.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:22,879
But if you're not familiar, it is a sandbox-style RPG crafting survival thing.

6
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:24,840
And it's one of those.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,360
It's like Terraria.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,240
And you are a little person who wakes up underground.
