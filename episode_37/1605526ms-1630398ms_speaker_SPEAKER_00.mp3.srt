00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Frostpunk, there was a lot more urgency to those decisions, and in this I felt like

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:13,680
it's a much more laid-back play, which, again, I don't really expect from a Cthulhu city builder.

00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,879
Like, I would expect constant urgency, and some people are wanting to rebel,

4
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:23,680
and some of the other gods are trying to horn in on the god you're worshiping's territory.

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,719
And so, anyway.
