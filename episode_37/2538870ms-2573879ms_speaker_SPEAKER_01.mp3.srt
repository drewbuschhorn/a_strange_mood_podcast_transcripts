00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
it's coming out. It's very much a me game. It's a, it's kind of

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,280
like Animal Crossing meets my time at Sandrock or whatever. So

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,760
it's 3d and you can play a little creature or a robot even

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,400
a little robot and you're settling in a seaside town and

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,920
rebuilding a tourist town and you have animals that move in

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,240
and it's extremely cute. And I asked them very nicely if as a

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,559
podcaster and streamer I could have early access and I got

8
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,400
early access. So we're gonna play that I'll probably play it

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,000
on stream and then we're going to talk about it.
