00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
So, I was trying to think if you had any major thoughts

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,320
about Dwarf Fortress lately.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,100
I'm kind of excited about getting the quest log back

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,240
and the ability to compose music.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,480
So I might be ready to pop back in there

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,240
once I finish my current projects

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,320
that are keeping me away from the computer.
