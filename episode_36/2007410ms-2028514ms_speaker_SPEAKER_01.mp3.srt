1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Yeah, and it's one of the best characters in the show because he's like very pragmatic and

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:12,480
knows things. And the primary villain so far is a sort of rival psychologist slash

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,120
demon guy. I don't even know what to describe him as played by Michael Emerson,

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,959
who was in Lost and he is excellent. Yeah, he does so good.
