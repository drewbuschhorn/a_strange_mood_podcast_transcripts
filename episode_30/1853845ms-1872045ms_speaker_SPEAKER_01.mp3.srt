1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
The ending of each line of the poem shares the same rhyme.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,080
The first line concerns the past.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,200
The second line concerns the future.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,740
So do you think this is a poem expressing pleasure

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,920
with a snake or a song expressing pleasure with a snake

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,100
that is also somehow used during marches

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,400
and military engagements?
