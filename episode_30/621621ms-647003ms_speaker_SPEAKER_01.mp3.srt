1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,060
Um, but I've spent all of our gems, or not all of them, but most of them.

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:08,120
So I've been having to like hunt out more gems to polish and use as currency.

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,400
So I begin to see why that's not necessarily the best currency.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:12,100
Yeah.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,219
Um, we've only had one artifact and it's not very exciting.

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,020
It is Craft Scryde, the Life of Treasuries.

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,940
It is a frilly dog leather head veil.
