Yeah, that's part of what inspired me to make the Guild Calls. So hopefully I can maybe persuade them

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,800
to do some training. But from... I had never seen the Master-Apprentice thing, so I just looked it

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:19,680
up in DFWiki. And the wiki didn't have animal trainers, caretakers as having apprentices or

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,879
whatever. But from the Scholar Wiki, it just says that the dwarves can form a Master-Apprentice

5
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,120
relationship and the Master will teach their apprentices their topic. A high teaching skill

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,439
for the Master and high student skill for the Apprentice leads to faster skill growth.
