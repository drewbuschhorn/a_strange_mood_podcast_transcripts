Yeah. Fair enough. I think the one that I miss most frequently is the second cavern layer,

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,880

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,440
I did find a slope downward at one point, but it didn't go all the way to the next cavern level.

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,040
So I was a little frustrated on that.
