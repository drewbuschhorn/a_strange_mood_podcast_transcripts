In my personal work, I've created some deep simulation structures like flower generators

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,480
that took several hundred inputs and outputted a biome-specific thematic fantasy realistic

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,920
plant with lists of properties and effects.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,600
That took me weeks to refine and perfect.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,760
Looking at the dozens of similarly styled systems in DF, this is the work of a large

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,080
development team with very good simulation design skills.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,760
It's an expensive proposition and the number of simulation designers out there are very,

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,760
very few.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,200
I really just loved the line.

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:29,760
I guess.
