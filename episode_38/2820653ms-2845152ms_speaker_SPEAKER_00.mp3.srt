1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
I don't think that I'm really playing anything else.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,760
Like I said, I'm kind of coming off Critter Cove a little, since I'm kind of reaching

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,840
what would be mid-game, and there isn't really yet, because it's early access.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,680
I've heard really mixed things about Frostpunk 2, so I'm not in a big hurry to buy that,

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,280
especially at the current price.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,280
It'll be on sale eventually.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,799
I might pick up Tiny Glades.

8
00:00:22,799 --> 00:00:23,799
Tiny Glade?

9
00:00:23,799 --> 00:00:24,799
Yeah.

10
00:00:24,799 --> 00:00:24,799
