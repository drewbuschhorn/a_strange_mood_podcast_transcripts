And it did say that they were going to get dragons in like July-August and it is now September.

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,120

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,959
to-do list because they predicted endgame by the end of the year and I'm not sure they're

4
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:18,320
going to make that target.
