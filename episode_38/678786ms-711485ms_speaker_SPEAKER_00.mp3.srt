1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
And when they reach the highest level,

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,960
you can teach them to with your current staff.

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,560
As a student, you can build in the tech tree stations

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,600
that raise students to apprentices.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,880
And then from there, they will get like an additional skill

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,719
slot and can go to a higher level

7
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:19,559
than your original staff.

8
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:21,639
It was going to take me too long to research that,

9
00:00:21,639 --> 00:00:23,920
so she just kind of promoted it.

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,040
But I did get my second student is now an apprentice.

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,760
His name is Byron.

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,360
He's another Wolfkin, nature mage.
