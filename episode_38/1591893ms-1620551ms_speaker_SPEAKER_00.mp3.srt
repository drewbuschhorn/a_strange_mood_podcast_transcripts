00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
I had a funny moment of thinking that world generation took forever, and I think that

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:09,840
I set my history to be really long, but then I realized also that I hadn't used my mods,

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,280
and I can't live without my no aquifers mod, and my realistic animals, and my bunny people,

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,080
so I had to go back and make a new one.

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,100
So yes, like I said, I've been working through Quickfort to get us established with bedrooms

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,280
and all of the basic work orders that make them happy.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,639
So like, having clothes.
