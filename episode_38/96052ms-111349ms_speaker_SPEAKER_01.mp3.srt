1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
There is several new features.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,760
The one I want to highlight is the idle crafting option,

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,480
which will allow you to set your dwarves

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,040
to satisfy their own need to create something

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,680
when they are idle.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,760
I'll just grab a workshop and get to work.
