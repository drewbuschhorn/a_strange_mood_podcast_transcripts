1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
Down to dice rolling.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:02,680
Absolutely.

3
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:07,160
Like this game is I think the most authentic D&D experience

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,160
I've ever had in a video game.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,440
It is, if you've ever been interested in D&D

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,600
but haven't played,

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,680
this is going to give you an authentic feel for it,

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,040
but without any annoying fellow players or PowerMed DM,

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,640
which honestly is maybe not that authentic

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,760
of a D&D experience.

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,720
But when it comes to reading the rule books

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,520
and you're like, I want to play D&D.
