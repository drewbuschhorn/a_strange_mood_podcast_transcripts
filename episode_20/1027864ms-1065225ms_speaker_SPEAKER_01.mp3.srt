1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,260
Yes, and the hook of the game is that you have had a mind flare larva inserted into

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:12,240
your brain that is giving you special powers and a connection to others with this larva

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,600
tadpole in their brain.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:21,560
And throughout the game, you make choices about whether or not to consume more of these

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,180
larva tadpoles and gain additional psionic type powers.

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:32,920
Some of them are very good and it's just a straight up useful thing to have, like if

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,220
someone hits you, you can charm them and then they can't attack you for their next turn.
