00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
Others later on give you just sort of not quite game-breaking but pretty game-changing abilities

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,560
including like the ability to fly at will. Because like in D&D you can learn a spell to fly

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,440
but that costs you mana, you know, it takes a spell slot, that sort of thing.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:17,920
Yeah.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,160
And in this you just can use this whenever you want.
