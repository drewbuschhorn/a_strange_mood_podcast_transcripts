00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,880
kind of separate from the rest of dnd but they fit pretty well into a different type of magic

00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:18,240
that is usually based around either just working or else charisma and in this case

00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,480
they just kind of are abilities that you can just use yeah
