00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
yeah just kind of well it's just sort of a swampy middle right yeah because but it's

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:10,160
hard to call it a swampy middle because the first act was very linear moving you along

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,520
because it was kind of a tutorial and then the second act again things were dark so you didn't

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,000
really like spend too much time exploring and instead kind of followed along where you were

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
told yeah but then after that you you just sort of got bogged down in all these random side stories

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,560
that weren't really leading you anywhere
