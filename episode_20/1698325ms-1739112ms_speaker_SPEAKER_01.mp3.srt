00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,880
Yeah, I did work to have a fairly happy ending this time. But even so, the endings aren't super

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,840
happy. Like, think about Shadowheart's ending. And this is where this game really shines is with

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,760
these character stories. Yeah. Which is funny, because one of my criticisms of the game is that

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,600
our character is not, the player character is not well developed. It's all on you to imagine

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:34,640
the story of your character. And it's not made explicit or even implicit in the game at all.

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,560
Were you on the mind flayer ship? Why were you selected to have a tadpole? Nothing.
