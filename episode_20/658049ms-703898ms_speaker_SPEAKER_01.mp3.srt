00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Sorcerer and Warlock are really kind of fuzzy and actually I say I always play Sorcerer

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,280
because that's what I play, that's the class in Diablo as well, but when I started this

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,800
character I looked long and hard at Warlock too because I hadn't played it and I decided

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,200
because of my track record of not finishing video games I should just make my path a little

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,960
easier and go with a class that I knew.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:31,960
And I actually found that while big RPGs like say a Dragon Age or a Divinity, which we tried

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,840
and kind of bounced off of, I'm very easily overwhelmed by the interface and the abilities

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,560
and it's like just too much to learn and so I'm not committed.

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:44,640
But with this I already knew 5e and I knew what Sorcerer could and couldn't do and I

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,680
felt pretty comfortable.
