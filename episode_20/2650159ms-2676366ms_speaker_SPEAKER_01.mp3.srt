00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
slog, not even a slog. It was just this battle of trying to do things he would like to raise his

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:12,720
esteem up to medium. And then his really emotional sequence and persuading him to not do this ritual

00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:18,880
that would make him like a supervillain, but presumably on my side. And for him to finally

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,000
get the resolution he needed and to call me a friend and it was just really touching. And then

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,080
his ending is kind of comedic.
