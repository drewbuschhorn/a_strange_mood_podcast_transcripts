00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,320
yeah um well and it's like the the demon guy who was showing up throughout i'm going to pursue that

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,880
line in in another playthrough and i'm sure at the time when i do it i will feel like oh my gosh how

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,480
did i play the game without this story which does make it very replayable but like that's so much

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,120
content it's so much gameplay and uh lucky for them i love re-watching rereading replaying things

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:36,240
so um the the dragon fight for will's quest line actually um is it was one one of the more epic

6
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:43,040
cool fights to me not just because it's a dragon because the boss had actual like mechanics that

7
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,000
he was doing and like there was one thing that you had to take cover from and these elemental

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,640
things that were resistant to certain damages and stuff like that and one of my complaints

9
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,440
about a lot of the fights were just that it was so much trash mobs so many trash mobs so that you

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,880
would be you would you know kill the boss and then the next 45 minutes would just be mopping up all

11
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:11,040
of the like 45 hit point half the hit point of the boss things and i think i would have rather

12
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,800
had fewer tougher enemies than just endless semi-easy
