00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
So Baldur's Gate 3, to try to convince you to buy it, is a good story in D&D because it is

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:17,040
reintegrating the Planescape setting from D&D, which hasn't really been in 5e super much.

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:25,680
And Planescape is interesting because it's sort of a steampunk space exploration setting in older

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,000
versions of Dungeons & Dragons, where there is a universe of crystal spheres that you can travel

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,240
through on the back of these steampunky wooden spaceships powered by wizards as their engines,

6
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:49,120
going across ethereal space that is also populated by bunches and bunches of high-level

7
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:56,640
evil creatures from D&D, including Mind Flayers, which are sort of hard to really describe,

8
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,800
but let's say Cthulhu-looking squid men.
