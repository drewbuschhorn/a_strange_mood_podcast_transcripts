1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
Right, like, I understand that you approve of my actions, but I'm a blank slate.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,840
I've said so little to you. But then I just steered into it and I was really glad because

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:18,080
Will's story, while not developed as a personal story, was an excellent world-building story.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,320
So I had this whole sequence where you go into a secret dungeon under the prison in Baldur's Gate

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,960
and you find the bones of a dragon that is supposed to be the protector. And, like,

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,480
you go into it all hyped, like, yes, I'm gonna have a dragon, I'm fighting on my side.

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,680
And you get there and it's dead. And when you go to loot it, because it has the little indicator

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,960
that there is stuff, it wakes up and confronts you, not because you're you and the hero, but

9
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:55,040
because your mind flayer companion is actually the Balderon who was one of the founders with

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,240
this dragon of the city.
