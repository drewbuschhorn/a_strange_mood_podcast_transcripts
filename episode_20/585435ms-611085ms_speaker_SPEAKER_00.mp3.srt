1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So, for those of you who haven't played D&D, or Baldur's Gate 3, because again, this is

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,360
going to be a weird episode where we're kind of talking about people who have played Baldur's

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,280
Gate, people who are trying to persuade to play Baldur's Gate, you just have an infinite

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,760
variety of character creation options.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,800
I believe there are twelve classes?

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,800
Maybe fewer.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,120
Or I can't remember offhand, but yeah.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,600
And then, like, ten races.
