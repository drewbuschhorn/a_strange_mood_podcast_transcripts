Act 2 is also, I think, where you're really starting to get into the hard moral choices in the game.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,100
Yeah.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:11,400
The first couple of times they present you with moral choices in the game, it's pretty clear what you're supposed to do.

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,600
Like, one of them is to save a child or let it get bitten by a snake and die.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,100
Mm-hmm.

00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,800
