00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,320
Right. I really limited the number of tadpoles that I consumed because I felt for moral purposes

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,560
and roleplay reasons, I guess, that my character was not going to be consuming them. And then the

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,280
characters that I rolled with also weren't big into the tadpoles, or you had to persuade them

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:29,200
to, and I didn't feel good about that in this particular playthrough. So we didn't use very

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,880
many of them. I used two or three, and I gave Asterian two or three, and then

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,040
at the end of the game I had some that I hadn't used.
