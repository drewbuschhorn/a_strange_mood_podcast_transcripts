I will be honest and say that when it was local on Steam Deck, I thought it looked like shit.

Like, it looked so bad for what is a really beautiful, atmospheric game.

When you were streaming it from your PC to your Steam Deck, it looked pretty good.

It looked better than when you played it locally, because the Steam Deck just isn't powerful enough.
