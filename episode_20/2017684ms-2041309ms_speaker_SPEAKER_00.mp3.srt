00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Yeah and you know the game still played along and I still felt like I got a satisfied story even

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,640
though I didn't and I didn't get any of that because I didn't really pursue Will or probably

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:16,160
some other plot threads that were dangled at me. Again a little bit of another example of how this

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,720
is very D&D like in that this is a big epic thing about Baldur's Gate we're apparently finding out

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,440
and I'm pretty sure they're gonna chuck it away.
