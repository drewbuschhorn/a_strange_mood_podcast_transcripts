1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
I'm not sure there really was a particular villain in act one.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,040
The closest would probably be Manthara,

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,920
the Drow leader,

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,680
who you can't actually get to be a part of your party,

14
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,440
