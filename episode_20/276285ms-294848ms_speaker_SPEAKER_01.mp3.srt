00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
You know, I, I finished playing the game last night and I noticed that the steam

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,240
achievement for finishing, it's only like 8% of the people.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:07,800
Yeah.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,240
So I, I'm sure it's that all games are that way, but, um, I

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,160
thought that was really funny.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,160
And I know people who are really enjoying it and playing a lot and

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,240
they're nowhere near finishing.

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:18,520
So.
