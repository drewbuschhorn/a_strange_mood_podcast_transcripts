I tend to agree. I also think that the AI just didn't really hold up to dealing with

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,920
small mobs. Because what I wound up doing a lot of times was kind of cheesing it and

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,340
casting area of effect spells, like in front of my characters and then just having my characters

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,400
stand still. And all of the trash mobs would just come running to me and die.

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,860
Yeah, they were really dumb.
