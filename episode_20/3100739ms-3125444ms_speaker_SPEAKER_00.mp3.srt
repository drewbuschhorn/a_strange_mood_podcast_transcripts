So I hope that we haven't spoiled the game too much for you if you're in finishing up Act 2, but

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,720
for the rest of you, I hope if you sat through it this long and hadn't decided to buy it,

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,040
you decide to buy it. It's quite good, and we should really reward people who are doing

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:22,960
something different. One of the controversies apparently with it was someone started a rumor

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,560
that they were being sued.
