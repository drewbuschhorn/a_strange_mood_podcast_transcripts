00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Yeah, you already spoke the language, the idioms.

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I think just at a high level, sorcerer is kind of closer to a video game magic user.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You've got the points and all that sort of thing.

00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Warlock is sort of a weird class where you've made a pact with a otherworldly power of some sort

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and so you basically cast very limited number of spells but incredibly powerful ones.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So, anyway.
