1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
And what's so funny is that I am the type of person who will spend money on cosmetic

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,600
items.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,200
And, you know, the fashion in this game is lacking a little.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,920
It really is.

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,920
So.

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,920
But I should be thankful.

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,880
Now I can just buy another horse for my Diablo character when we go back to that.

8
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,880
Exactly.

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,920
Well, I think that that covers it for this time.

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,800
And we're both, I think, actually excited to get back to Dwarf Fortress.

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,280
I'm going to let Wet-Ringed run down while I edit the podcast episode in the morning

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,880
and see how it ends.
