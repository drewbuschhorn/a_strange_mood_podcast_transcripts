00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Yes, it's important to remember who gets the killing blow on who though.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:04,960
Yes.

00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,160
I wasted a couple of talk to deads because my rogue was a killing machine

00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,440

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,320
I feel like this outline isn't going quite as organically as I wanted it to.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:18,560
Yeah.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,440
