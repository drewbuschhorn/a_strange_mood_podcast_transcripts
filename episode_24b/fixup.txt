[00:00:00] Kristin:
Hello, and welcome to A Strange Mood, the Couples Dwarf Fortress podcast. I'm Kristin. 

[00:00:04] Drew:
And I'm Drew. 

[00:00:05] Kristin:
And we're a couple playing Dwarf Fortress. 

[00:00:08] Drew:
That we are, Kristin, that we are. Usually. Actually, no, we're not really this week. 

[00:00:13] Kristin:
Not this week, no. 

[00:00:15] Kristin:
So, you know how we built our house on top of a volcano? 

[00:00:20] Drew:
Uh-huh. 

[00:00:20] Kristin:
Yep, it seemed like a good idea at the time. Well, the goblins we hired to lift our house onto stilts have finished, but now it's sagging in the middle like a soggy plump helmet cake. 

[00:00:32] Kristin:
But tomorrow they're coming to pour liquid for us to float on, so I'm sure we'll be fine. 

[00:00:37] Drew:
Don't talk to me about plump helmet cakes. I think I ate a bad one yesterday, and now I'm seeing visions of a lungfish god. 

[00:00:44] Drew:
And it's not happy with me. Something about several years of backed-up prayer debt and fish sticks. 

[00:00:50] Drew:
So, we're in the same boat. Plus, I don't know if you know, but our dog is limping around after the last round of crundle-killing. 

[00:00:58] Kristin:
Well, maybe we can skim off some of the liquid gold for the vet. 

[00:01:02] Drew:
It's an idea, at least. 

[00:01:03] Kristin:
It's one way to pay for it. 

[00:01:04] Drew:
Everyone's sort of okay, but it's been a week for us here. 

[00:01:08] Kristin:
It really has. 

[00:01:09] Drew:
So we're going to call a mulligan on this episode and bring you on in another two weeks, followed by a break until after the new year. 

[00:01:16] Kristin:
Yes, with the holiday this week as well for us here in the United States, we just need a little bit of time. 

[00:01:22] Drew:
Yeah. 

[00:01:23] Kristin:
To human. 

[00:01:23] Drew:
Get over stomach bugs, dogs being sick.
[00:01:27] Kristin:
House construction, everything.

[00:01:30] Kristin:
But we've got a bunch of interesting projects lined up for the break that we think you'll like. Some new ideas, some old ones.

[00:01:36] Kristin:
Maybe a video or two for those of you who watch on YouTube and some ideas for what we're going to do in the Discord.

[00:01:42] Drew:
Yeah, so I think we've got some interesting things there, but on to the news.

[00:01:47] Drew:
The Adventure Mode previews are out, both on Kitfox and on Blind IRL's channel.

[00:01:52] Drew:
They both look pretty cool, with a little chat window with portraits when your adventurer is talking to a rando, such as a... Hippopotamus... Hippopotamus man...

[00:02:01] Kristin:
Can I put a pot on this man?

[00:02:02] Drew:
hippopotamus man wrestler.

[00:02:04] Kristin:
Oh, that's fun.

[00:02:06] Drew:
So watch out, Caves of Qud.

[00:02:07] Drew:
The brothers are coming for you!

[00:02:09] Kristin:
Hoo-hoo.

[00:02:10] Drew:
And speaking of the Caves of Qud, they've also dropped a big new update, so check that out too if you've not played in a little while.

[00:02:16] Kristin:
Steven's released episode 4 of Learned Hands over on YouTube, a banger as always.

[00:02:22] Kristin:
And Krug Smash has released several more episodes of Spirit Cavern.

[00:02:27] Drew:
Meanwhile, Fangamer has a bunch of awesome new merch to check out, including a journal begging to be used as a book of grudges. That's for all the Warhammer fans out there.

[00:02:36] Kristin:
Mm-hmm.

[00:02:36] Drew:
and a hoodie that actually menaces with spikes. Also, vinyl music.

[00:02:40] Kristin:
Yeah, I think I want one of everything, so that's like my Christmas list.

[00:02:44] Drew:
It really is kind of, especially because the hoodie is a little much.

[00:02:45] Kristin:
There's a journal, a hoodie, and a vinyl, and yeah, they're kind of pricey, but they're all very cool.

[00:02:52] Drew:
Okay, back to our sickbeds and less demanding games like Diablo 4 for the moment. We'll see you in a week or two, same bat time, same bat channel.

[00:03:00] Kristin:
Be sure to join our Discord, and remember...

[00:03:02] Drew:
Just keep digging!

[00:03:10] Drew:
I'm gonna take it from the top.

[00:03:10] Kristin:
No, no. And we are a couple, right? Yeah. Okay. And this is a dwarf. Oh my god. I'm so rusty.
