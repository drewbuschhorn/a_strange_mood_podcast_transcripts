00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Exactly. I'm assuming maybe you put toys in there or something to attract them?

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,400
Yeah.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,280
Because you make a guild hall by designating it as a usual type of meeting zone and then

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,760
there's an option in the panel to select the particular guild that you want it to be.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,260
Yeah.
