1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Yes. I talked a little bit about Rivad's marriage and their 10 children. And I checked in on her

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,200
husband to see how he felt about his wife's death. And either he is unaware, or just doesn't care.

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:24,480
Abbas Bellriddles is currently ecstatic. He has the happiest mood. And I noticed is a legendary

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:32,400
metal crafter. He is the one that I had assigned to our metal crafting workshop thingy. And some

5
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:38,080
of his contributing factors to his good mood are feeling proud of the metal statues he has created

6
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,760
for Wet Ring, and for teaching someone actually, which is something that we'll talk about a little

7
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,160
bit later with Guild Halls. Oh, yeah, that's our topic for today. I guess we didn't mention that

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:55,440
we're going to talk about Guild Halls. He also had, um, I noticed that he had created a something.

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,160
So I went into the into Legends mode, because the name of what he was the creator of was cut off in

10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,400
his character sheet. And it was Grimtaxt the Bronze Earring, his family heirloom, that was

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,160
recently destroyed at Wet Ring. Though I didn't ever get a notification or know what happened.

12
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:20,720
Maybe, maybe his wife was wearing it, and she she died. But I perhaps we'll never know. I looked

13
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,840
it up and couldn't find out. Yeah, yeah. And in further looking him up, he he's quite the guy.

14
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:35,440
He's like 137. I think he has 18 children, 18, 18, only 10 of which were with the former mayor,

15
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,600
as he was both married and divorced before he met Urvaad.
