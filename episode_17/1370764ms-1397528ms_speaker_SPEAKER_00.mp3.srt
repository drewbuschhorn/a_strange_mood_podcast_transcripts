00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Yeah, I mean, that's going to be the plan. We'll turn it into a terrarium of some sort.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,160
But yeah, we've gotten all of those ancient treasures,

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,600
which unfortunately I'm always kind of sad are not really interesting to talk about

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,680
because they're just, you know, like twisted metal or whatever. So they're very powerful,

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,200
but they don't have anything interesting description-wise. So we've only had one

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,560
weird artifact created, which was the gold statue of a moon snail man.
