1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
Oh, yes, I bet it was blocks and I forgot about that damn blocks. Yeah, she needed rock blocks. Oh well

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,820
So she she's dead, but we did have some successful artifacts

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,380
cog standard fences a stone worker

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:22,680
Created the high rim a limonite crown worth 12,000 more for us. Yeah, that's some skill if it's made out of limonite

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,440
It's encrusted it has gold on it

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:32,240
It's encrusted with cushioned limonite cabochons and oval native gold cabochons and decorated with dog bone

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:40,280
Subject menaces with spikes of dog bone and milk quartz and it was fortunate for a cog that I had had to do a mass puppy

8
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,360
Slaughter right before this happened because we wouldn't have had any other bones. I don't think so

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:52,800
Yeah, he got lucky timing wise and then we also had a very boring artifact made by besmar paddled

10
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,800
tramples a gelder

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:01,560
He made the spattered stigma, which is a cool name kind of metal goth a little metal especially coming
