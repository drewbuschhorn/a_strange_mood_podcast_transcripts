00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
Yes, it's an impressive name. She's not married and has no family members at Wet-Ringed, but she

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,440
has many close friends among the dwarves, and she's a little unhappy currently because she still needs

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,280
better quarters and an office and a dining hall and all of that stuff. But she began her tenure

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:23,120
as mayor by banning the export of bolts, which we're not making anyway and we're getting rid of.

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,000
Yeah, fair enough.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,160
Yeah. In other news, we did lose a gem cutter to a strange mood. She needed rock and inexplicably

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,600
could not get rock. She was surrounded by rock. I made a stockpile full of rock right next to the

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,880
workshop while she was slowly going mad, and it was not the right kind of rock, I guess.
