00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
He did have another 10. Yes. And he became a blacksmith after his imprisonment. And yeah,

his dream in his character sheet was to raise a family. And this dream obviously was realized.

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,880
Many times. Yes. And then I kind of went down a little rabbit hole looking up embezzlement

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,720
because I had no idea it was a thing. And you also encountered it this week,

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,680
which we will talk about. And that was part of the villains update to the game,

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:36,160
which was before my time. And dwarves can be tempted by nefarious villains. But in this case,

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,080
there's no indication that he was led astray by any mysterious person. He just embezzled.
