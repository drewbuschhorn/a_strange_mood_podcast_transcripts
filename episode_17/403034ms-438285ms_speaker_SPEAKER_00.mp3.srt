1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yeah, so finally for Eratta,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,020
one of our community members, Gash,

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,400
was kind enough to point out that actually

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,360
on the Dwarf Fortress Wiki,

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,280
there is a section for fort challenges of different types.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,440
It's actually quite extensive.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,780
And if you were interested in our previous episode

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,520
where we talked about challenges

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,780
that you could do with your fort,

10
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,120
you should go check that out for some of the ideas there.

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,440
Although I think as the Steam Workshop stuff improves,

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,740
there'll be more opportunities

13
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,240
to do that in a more public way.

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,080
Yes.
