1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
They weren't doing much damage or anything, so I've, again, been using cage traps to deal

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,880
with these things.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:12,880
And so I have, it's got to be upwards of 30 different creatures in cages, and I don't

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,560
know what to do with them, so I just put them down in the bottom cavern level, and they're

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,560
sitting there.

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,480
And some of the troglodytes and naked mole dogs have had children and or puppies, and

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,600
now those are in the cages.

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,360
So we might train some naked mole dogs, I guess.

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,480
You can train troglodytes, but I don't want to.

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,760
That one weirds me out a little bit.

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,760
And let's see.

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,280
There was a notification that a hunter was hunting, which is apparently a thing that

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,080
you get, and I don't care, but it was really ominous to have it pop up and say, so-and-so,

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,080
a hunter is hunting.

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,080
Like, what are you hunting?

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,080
