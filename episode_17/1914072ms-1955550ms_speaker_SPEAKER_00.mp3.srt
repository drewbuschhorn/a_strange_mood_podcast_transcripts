This reminds me of one of my favorite bugs for Dwarf Fortress that I think is fixed at this stage, but with the right amount of luck, when a dwarf makes a statue or other kind of artistic item that has a topic, they could hit recursion and make an image of themselves, and it would just loop out until it stopped.

And I always thought that was hilarious, people would have that, because it would also then make it very valuable because it kept having more and more...

It's so intricate.

Yeah. I think that was a fun little... Is it a bug or a feature?
