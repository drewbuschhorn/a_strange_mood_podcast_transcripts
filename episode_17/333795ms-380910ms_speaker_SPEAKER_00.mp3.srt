1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
Sounds bad.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:05,080
After he decapitated Grump Gromp the Roach Man.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,720
But he has several more steps to take.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,280
One of those, of course, being Buffy.

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,360
He has made quite the impact on the crowd

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,280
with his hefty platinum pick, Buffy has.

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,360
But Buffy collapsed in a puddle of his own ichor,

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,800
swinging wildly.

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,520
Ichor?

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,020
Ichor?

11
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:20,640
Ichor?

12
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,200
Ichor?

13
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,560
Ichor.

14
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,880
Swinging wildly with his pickaxe while hoof loomed over him.

15
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,720
Buffy's flailing rapidly weakened, though,

16
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,320
as the flow of ichor from his stump

17
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,560
slow before finally stopping altogether.

18
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,800
Congratulations to Haruf on his victory.

19
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,200
And alas, Yeti stooned to become spaghetti, became spaghetti.

20
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,240
And Dead Death Roll, the reptile man with the axe guitar,

21
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,640
also lost his fight.

22
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,200
Mm, too bad.

23
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,080
So basically everyone we talked about last time

24
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,200
wound up dying this round.

25
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,760
That's OK.
