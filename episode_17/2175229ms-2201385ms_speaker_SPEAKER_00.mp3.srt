1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
Yeah, I made the traps, animal traps, or small traps,

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,240
or whatever the hell it's called,

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,080
that is what you supposedly need in order to catch live fish

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,040
and put them into things.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,040
And it doesn't seem to do anything.

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,240
They just sort of stand there with them.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,560
Anyway, I'm moving on from that.

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,800
I'm finding a different topic.

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,600
I'm having fun digging out the obsidian.

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,440
Oh, yes.
