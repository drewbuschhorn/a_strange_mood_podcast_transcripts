1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
is which. Yeah, that's the big thing. I started decorating mine before I knew what a, what the

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,160
ranger really meant. And I was thinking in terms of like, you know, Aragorn or D&D classes. And I

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,520
was like, I don't know, a dwarf with a bow. And when you're making that, designating the custom

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:28,080
statue, you have like the X and Y and choose like an action or whatever. And I was making a dwarf

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,640
shooting a bow. But then it occurred to me that I don't know transitive intransitive,

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,680
but I don't know if the dwarf was shooting the bow as in drawing the bow to shoot it or

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,920
shooting the bow with something else, possibly another bow.
