It was created by the human god Kikofluebastion and is a part with birth, discipline, laws, marriage, oaths, and pregnancy.

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It killed ten dwarves before we were able to bring it down.

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Whoa.

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The interesting thing with that for me is that it said something like it was the enforcer of laws,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
which as I looked into it and then realized that it was made by the god Kikofluebastion,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I realized that it was called the enforcer of laws because laws was one of the spheres that Kikofluebastion was in charge of.
