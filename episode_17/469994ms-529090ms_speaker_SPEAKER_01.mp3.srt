1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Who cares?

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Fiery cities.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Anyway, we're doing well.

4
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,800
We've had a population boom, and now have 86 dwarves in residence.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,800
Oh my.

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,480
It was at 77, and then while I was taking notes this afternoon, we got those remaining

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,480
nine dwarves.

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,800
So, very exciting.

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,640
I'm also pleased to report that the mystery of Ral, the dead drunk from last week, has

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,420
been solved, because our mayor, that I also talked about last week, Urvad Atulalan, was

11
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,940
also found dead.

12
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,180
And you know, I had started the justice, and there was no mysteries or anything like that,

13
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,700
and then I started getting all these combat notifications, and realized that there was

14
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:45,500
a giant ulm in the caverns that was fighting with dwarves, and it was named, and I looked

15
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,420
at its kills, and the mystery was solved.

16
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,220
So now we know.

17
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:55,780
I still don't know why he was just described as drunk, but maybe he was drunk at time of

18
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,380
death, and now that's what he's remembered for.
