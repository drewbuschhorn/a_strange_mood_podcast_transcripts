00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,040

00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:16,080
But yeah, because I've talked so long about doing a library-type fort, and you know, we

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,280
could make some paper maybe.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,200
I haven't actually started to research what goes into making paper yet, but...
