1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,240
Leftovers.

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,680
Supposedly, we will have much fewer instances

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,080
of food lying around and rotting

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,040
because food that is dropped will no longer be marked

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,680
as owned by anyone and so can be cleaned up.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,520
Excellent.

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,280
As opposed to just sitting there and rotting

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,960
until someone comes back for it.
