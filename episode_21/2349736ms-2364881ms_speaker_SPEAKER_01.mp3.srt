00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Well, you could say the same about me if I looked up any of the weaving and spinning things involved in Dwarf Fortress.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It is true.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yeah.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So that's been the only real item that's been created,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
but I'm excited about it because I think that'll be useful for doing my lava work.
