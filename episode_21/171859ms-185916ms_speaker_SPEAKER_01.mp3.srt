Yeah, well, I mean, it kind of ran on Linux

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,640
before if you use the emulator, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,120
I shouldn't blah, blah, blah.

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,200
Steam has done a great job with that emulator,

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,480
with supporting the Proton emulator.

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,840
But still, now supposedly it runs natively.

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,280
I don't know.
