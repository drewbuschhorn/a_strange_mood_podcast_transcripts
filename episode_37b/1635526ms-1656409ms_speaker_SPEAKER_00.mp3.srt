00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:04,800
Yeah.

00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,520

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,560
Yeah. And I don't know that that has changed. Like I know that they've done updates,

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,320
but it's not, they made it very clear that it's not a live service game.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,719
