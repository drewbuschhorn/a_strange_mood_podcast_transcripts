[00:00:00] Kristin:
This podcast is of the highest quality.

[00:00:19] Kristin:
Hello, and welcome to A Strange Mood, the Couple's Dwarf Fortress podcast. I'm Kristin.

[00:00:23] Drew:
And I'm Drew.

[00:00:24] Kristin:
And we are a couple.

[00:00:25] Drew:
Not playing Dwarf Fortress right now.

[00:00:27] Kristin:
That's right, we are actually going to talk about a different game specifically.

[00:00:31] Kristin:
Um, because the very kind people at Gentleman Rat Studios gave me early access to Critter Cove, Critter Cove.
[interjection] Drew: Critter

[00:00:39] Drew:
Critter Cove, that's where we're at.

[00:00:41] Kristin:
Yep, it's been...

[00:00:42] Kristin:
It hasn't even been a long week, it's only Tuesday.

[00:00:45] Kristin:
Kritter Cove, it's very fun, and we talked about it a little bit last time, but I wanted to give more thoughts after having spent

[00:00:52] Kristin:
In the last week, I've spent 20 hours playing this game.

[00:00:55] Drew:
Okay then.

[00:00:56] Kristin:
It's a lot of hours. So we did stream it once. It wasn't a very long stream because I got really motion sick.

[00:01:03] Kristin:
Which we will talk about.

[00:01:05] Kristin:
As we discuss the game some more.

[00:01:08] Drew:
That's not a super criticism against the game, because you get motion sick about everything.

[00:01:12] Kristin:
Yeah, that's a me problem, not a Critter Cove problem.

[00:01:16] Drew:
When we were first playing ESO, you had real trouble completing the tutorial missions because a lot of them involved going around.

[00:01:27] Drew:
Um, climbing spiral staircases.

[00:01:29] Kristin:
Spiral staircases, I remember at one point I had to make you finish because I was not sure that I wasn't going to be sick and you said I was actively green.

[00:01:39] Kristin:
So yeah, 3D games and me, it's a troubled relationship.

[00:01:45] Kristin:
So what is Critter Cove?

[00:01:47] Drew:
Critter Cove is a deep, open-world life sim and town-building game set in a cozy post-apocalyptic paradise. Restore an old town, sail across a mysterious archipelago,

[00:01:58] Drew:
Hunt for relics, and farm, fish, craft everything you need.

[00:02:02] Drew:
Can you turn Critter Cove into a thriving tourist town once again?

[00:02:07] Kristin:
That's right. That's what it is.

[00:02:09] Kristin:
Um, so this is kind of an Animal Crossing meets My Time at Portia game. Basically, the idea of restoring a place to its former glory while making friends and decorating along the way.

[00:02:21] Drew:
Friends seems like a strong word based on what you've told me.

[00:02:25] Kristin:
Um, some of these little creatures are very mean.

[00:02:29] Kristin:
Just today, one of them who's actually quite nice wanted me to refresh her wardrobe, so I brought her a shirt and it was kind of a sacrifice on my part because it was a shirt that I liked and had worn, and I thought it would look cute on her, and she hated it so much that she said, "Who would wear this?"

[00:02:46] Drew:
You.

[00:02:47] Kristin:
Yeah.

[00:02:48] Kristin:
And then there was the one that told me I smell like I wear dirty horse blankets.

[00:02:53] Drew:
Which seems surprisingly targeted.

[00:02:56] Kristin:
Yeah, I was a little worried about that one.

[00:02:59] Kristin:
I mean, I have a new car, so it doesn't smell like a wet horse blanket, but the old one did.

[00:03:05] Drew:
Also, we have horse blankets hanging out right now, getting the scent off them.

[00:03:10] Kristin:
Yeah, one of my horses is very smelly.

[00:03:13] Drew:
She's a dirty bird.

[00:03:14] Kristin:
She's nasty.

[00:03:15] Kristin:
It is. And it is.

[00:03:15] Drew:
And it's funny because everyone looks at her and thinks she's the elegant one.

[00:03:18] Kristin:
Exactly.
Oh, yeah, they look at her compared to my pony and think she's, you know, the pretty princess. No, she's nasty; she rolls 

[00:03:24] Drew:
She rolls around in her pee.

[00:03:25] Kristin:
Yeah, she does. It's gross.

[00:03:27] Kristin:
Uh, yeah, so in the midst of making friends and decorating, you craft things, furniture specifically, and attractions to put around your island. You explore the ruins that are around on some of the other islands, and that involves diving.

[00:03:47] Drew:
Yes, when it says archipelago, they really do mean that, and you spend a lot of time on a boat.

[00:03:52] Kristin:
Yes, you do. And I kind of wish I could upgrade my boat so that maybe it will go faster.

[00:03:56] Kristin:
Because it's not very fast. And then you find little lore bits about how...

[00:04:02] Kristin:
The water is slowly rising, and soon we're all going to need wetsuits. And it feels very much like global warming.

[00:04:09] Drew:
Mm-hmm.

[00:04:10] Kristin:
And then you find the critters, and there are all kinds of critters. So, like, I'm playing as a raccoon.

[00:04:17] Drew:
I played with the character creator for something like two hours or three hours; it felt like.

[00:04:21] Kristin:
It wasn't three, but it was definitely over an hour because I was trying to perfect my raccoon look.

[00:04:27] Kristin:
Which I have, I think I look very raccoonish.

[00:04:29] Drew:
You look very fetching.

[00:04:30] Kristin:
Yes, thank you.

[00:04:33] Drew:
It's a game to turn people into furries.

[00:04:35] Kristin:
It's really not, and they keep saying they're not going to add romance, so stop asking.

[00:04:42] Kristin:
No judgment, we don't kink shame here, but yes, so I spent a really long time, and you can be any kind of furry creature. You can be a lizard, you can be a robot, you can be a furry creature lizard robot.

[00:04:58] Drew:
Fair enough.

[00:04:59] Kristin:
Yeah, and in the demo, I made like a little humanoid with horns, and then it kind of creeped me out. So I did not carry my demo save file over.

[00:05:09] Drew:
But can you be a unicorn?

[00:05:10] Kristin:
Yes, I think there's a horse's face, but I have a bunnicorn. It's a rabbit with a unicorn horn and fairy wings.

[00:05:18] Kristin:
Who was tripping on some funny berries when I met them.

[00:05:21] Drew:
Well, I think if you're a bunnicorn, you probably spend a lot of your time high just to deal with the pain that is life.

[00:05:27] Kristin:
Uh, no, he seems to be enjoying his life. I don't know what his pronoun is.

[00:05:31] Drew:
Oh, so, uh, that one is there. Yeah. That one isn't continually nagging you.

[00:05:36] Kristin:
No, no, he's too high.

[00:05:39] Drew:
What's the one that is continually nagging you?

[00:05:41] Kristin:
Sammy the lizard, who I couldn't find anyone who would be happy working in my clothing store because you build stores for these tourists that come.

[00:05:50] Kristin:
And then you have to employ one of your recruiters there for it to function. And they were all like, just their soul was being crushed by working in retail.

[00:05:58] Kristin:
And then the nagging one was like, "You mean I get to decide what people wear and tell them when they look awful? Sign me up."

[00:06:06] Drew:
All right.

[00:06:06] Kristin:
Yeah, all right. And loves the job.

[00:06:09] Drew:
What were some of the good insults from him, besides the horse blanket? I felt like you had a couple. Oh, I have-

[00:06:13] Kristin:
But, um, that would take time to look them up, but yes, there's a lot of nagging, and like when you give them furniture, they'll be like, "This is great. It can collect dust."

[00:06:28] Drew:
They are much more mean than Animal Crossing.

[00:06:30] Kristin:
Yes, I gather that in earlier installments of Animal Crossing, there were mean animals. There are no longer mean animals in Animal Crossing. And then, I guess, go ahead.
[interjection] Drew: Mean animals and animals

[00:06:43] Drew:
I just feel like if you let little kids play this game, they might cry because their bestie just made fun of them.

[00:06:49] Kristin:
I mean, a friend of mine is playing, and is like, "I need that negging lizard off my island. I do not need that energy in my life."
[interjection] Drew: You
[interjection] Kristin: I don't want this.

[00:06:59] Drew:
So, if you throw people out, where do they go?

[00:07:03] Kristin:
I don't know.

[00:07:04] Drew:
Not your problem. Yep.

[00:07:05] Kristin:
Yep, that's actually, I have not achieved the ability to evict people yet. So

[00:07:12] Kristin:
I'mâ€”I have just these people. My most recent creature acquisition looks like...

[00:07:17] Kristin:
a sort of steampunk red panda with

[00:07:19] Kristin:
a monocle

[00:07:24] Drew:
Steampunk furries, oh god

[00:07:26] Kristin:
Oh, no, without kink-shaming. Okay, so to explain the tourism thing, because one of my criticisms of this game is that some of the mechanics are not necessarily taught to you by the game, and so I know what I am about to describe because one of the devs told us in the Discord. But so you attract tourists once you get the basics of your town up and running, and I guess that in

[00:07:57] Kristin:
spreadsheet terms, they all have a list of things that they want to do on vacation and

[00:08:02] Kristin:
you are deducted a small amount of money for everything they can't do, and then you get money for everything that they can do.

[00:08:10] Drew:
Interesting.

[00:08:11] Kristin:
Yeah, so I would see myself losing money while I had tourists, and I was like, what the hell? Are they stealing from me? What's happening? And I just kind of explained it to myself as, um...

[00:08:19] Kristin:
You know, they're like, I'm

[00:08:21] Kristin:
It's like

[00:08:22] Kristin:
hiring staff, you know, and paying for

[00:08:25] Kristin:
utilities? I don't know, something like that, but no, apparently that's...

[00:08:29] Kristin:
it's that they're unsatisfied. And I knew that some of them had been unsatisfied because if they want like a snack and the cafe isn't open, they'll like cross their arms and stomp around your town being all mad.

[00:08:41] Drew:
The towns, when I watched you play, do seem very alive, even more so than Animal Crossing.
[interjection] Kristin: Even more.
[interjection] Drew: Because I feel like with Animal Crossing, frequently the animals kind of stayed close to their homes.

[00:08:50] Kristin:
Yeah.

[00:08:50] Drew:
And in this, it's very three-dimensional, and they are very
[interjection] Kristin: Yes.

[00:08:55] Drew:
active, going around and running up and flagging you down.

[00:08:58] Kristin:
Yeah, and they will use things that you put around the town. So like, they'll sit in a beach chair, and they'll...

[00:09:04] Kristin:
Not exactly play with the sandcastle, but they'll stand near the sandcastle and stuff like that.

[00:09:10] Drew:
I wonder if you're kind of like a party planner in the same way as, um, what's the reality TV show you watch where they are on a boat?

[00:09:18] Kristin:
Oh, uh, Below Deck.

[00:09:20] Drew:
Below Deck. It seems like that they probably have penalties if they can't do something.

[00:09:25] Kristin:
Right, yeah. Actually, that could be a fun game. Below Deck, the game.

[00:09:30] Kristin:
Um, but...

[00:09:31] Kristin:
Yes, so that's kind of the basics, and I'm 20 hours in, and I'm only getting to the point where I'm starting to upgrade my workshops to make
Fancier stuff. And I have, so I have the lighthouse up and running. I think that's the first thing you do. I have a clothing store because fashion is very important. That's the first thing I unlocked. And I'm working on opening the tavern, which I still need to acquire a couple of rusty old taps because you get blueprints to make things by dismantling old broken-down ones.

[00:10:03] Kristin:
Old broken-down ones.

[00:10:04] Drew:
And so why don't you tell the listeners about what I screwed up for you?

[00:10:08] Kristin:
Oh, yes. So there is obviously this is a water world, and

[00:10:13] Kristin:
you go looking at a lot of shipwrecks, and there's a lot of diving involved under the water.

[00:10:19] Kristin:
Um, this is kind of another thing that it's, it's partly on me, and

[00:10:23] Kristin:
I don't know, maybe a little on the game, but...

[00:10:26] Kristin:
You can early on unlock a scuba mask and air tank thing.

[00:10:33] Kristin:
I didn't know that, so I was trying to do all these incredibly deep dives in, you know, the 20 seconds, 30 seconds you have before you start to run out of air. When you start to run out of air, you also start to lose health.

[00:10:45] Kristin:
So I was getting sick because we kept trying this, so I handed you the controller to try it, and you stayed down way too long.

[00:10:53] Kristin:
So then I passed out and took a bunch of damage, and then

[00:10:57] Kristin:
when I got back, my movement was slowed to like a crawl because I was in such bad shape.

[00:11:02] Kristin:
I had to sleep through three days to recover.

[00:11:05] Drew:
Yeah, I thought that was interesting that the penalty
[interjection] Kristin: Yeah.
[interjection] Drew: persisted for a surprisingly long time.

[00:11:12] Kristin:
Yeah, I have not yet opened up a clinic, and I'm actually, I don't know how, like I don't, I just don't know if I've gotten to that point. But like I had one visitor who was complaining of sunburn,

[00:11:26] Kristin:
and complaining that they didn't have a clinic to go to.

[00:11:29] Kristin:
And I think maybe if I'd gone to the clinic, I could have recovered faster.

[00:11:33] Drew:
I think that's probably the case. Also, it's a post-apocalyptic world. I would backhand him and say, grow a pair.

[00:11:40] Kristin:
Also, he's covered in fur.

[00:11:43] Kristin:
It's not like our dog who's basically bald.

[00:11:45] Drew:
Yeah.

[00:11:46] Kristin:
But I don't know,

[00:11:47] Kristin:
It happens. I won't negate his experience. I'm sure it was very traumatic, but, um...

[00:11:53] Kristin:
So as you can see, a lot of pluses, it's very fun, and the game loop is pretty rewarding because you're just constantly finding salvage. The community is really enthusiastic and just loves talking about it.

[00:12:07] Drew:
And the devs seem really nice.

[00:12:08] Kristin:
Nice, yeah. The devs are in the Discord, they are talking to you, and I reported a bug, and they were immediately like, "Okay, I'll hunt that down," and then like an hour later, we're like, "Okay, I found it. I don't think it's been patched yet, but they're working a lot, yeah. You, it's very customizable, so you can be whatever you want to be.

[00:12:32] Kristin:
And then I also like how many accessibility features it has for like motion sickness, like me. It's not their fault that I can't

[00:12:42] Drew:
Yeah.

[00:12:43] Drew:
They, because they have the motion sickness reticle, they have field of view, they have
[interjection] Kristin: They have

[00:12:49] Kristin:
They...

[00:12:50] Drew:
turn motion blur on and off

[00:12:51] Kristin:
or whatever it is, yeah.

[00:12:53] Kristin:
There's a ton of that, and I was able to play with it a lot and make it more comfortable for myself, but I have to kind of cap myself to play for like 30 minutes or so.
And then I got to make myself take a break.

[00:13:06] Drew:
How does it run on Steam Deck?

[00:13:07] Kristin:
Really well, but you get a little bit of lag here and there.

[00:13:11] Kristin:
I don't know if that lag exists on PC. I don't remember seeing it when we streamed it. I get motion sickness more when I'm on PC than on handheld, so I haven't played a ton on PC.

[00:13:23] Drew:
Yeah, that's just because of the bigger screen, I think.

[00:13:25] Kristin:
Yep, but it's fully functional.

[00:13:27] Kristin:
Um, so in terms of the cons column, like,

[00:13:32] Kristin:
It is very early access, so you'll find bugs, typos, and a few features that are just...

[00:13:39] Kristin:
Missing.

[00:13:40] Kristin:
Um, like the Snack Shack, I've seen a lot of people frustrated, and I actually noticed this.

[00:13:45] Kristin:
And at the bottom, it's, there's like,

[00:13:47] Kristin:
"accepts foods:" and a colon and a bunch of dashes, and I was like,

[00:13:52] Kristin:
Hmm, I think something's missing here, and there is indeed something missing there. They just haven't put the list, and I found out what I wanted through trial and error.

[00:13:59] Drew:
Yep.

[00:14:02] Kristin:
But so in some ways, I feel a little bit like we in early access are doing the beta testing.

[00:14:08] Drew:
I think that's fair for some early access stuff.

[00:14:10] Kristin:
Yeah. Finally, the roadmap is really ambitious, which is great. That's a huge plus. They're adding an enchanted area and all kinds of stuff.

[00:14:21] Kristin:
There's not, they don't, I haven't really seen it dated. Like,

[00:14:25] Kristin:
when Sun Haven came out, they had like clear dates for when

[00:14:29] Kristin:
the big updates were going to come. We don't have that. But full release is in 2026.

[00:14:36] Kristin:
Nice. So, I do, I mean, I definitely have some notes on it, but it's early access, so.

[00:14:41] Drew:
Yeah, early access is always kind of a little bit of a challenge to navigate, I feel like. We've played a fair number of games in early access over the years. I don't know, what jumps out to you from the games you've played in early access in the past?

[00:14:55] Kristin:
Well, the most immediate one for me is CoreKeeper because they just got their 1.0.

[00:14:59] Drew:
Mm-hmm.

[00:15:00] Kristin:
And they added so much, more classes, more areas, and stuff like that.

[00:15:05] Kristin:
Um, we didn't play a ton of it though in early access, so I don't necessarily know

[00:15:11] Kristin:
how that felt beforehand versus after.

[00:15:14] Drew:
Yeah, I think this is maybe the peril of early access because the benefits are manifold for the developer, right?

[00:15:23] Drew:
First off, they frequently get money.

[00:15:25] Kristin:
Yeah.

[00:15:25] Kristin:
You get the money to keep working on it.
[interjection] Drew: Get the money.

[00:15:27] Drew:
Exactly. And that's important. You get beta testers.

[00:15:32] Drew:
Whatever you want to call them at that sort of level. And also, you frequently get kind of a self-selected group who are willing to put up with a little bit more.

[00:15:41] Drew:
Again, go back to the Dwarf Fortress community.

[00:15:43] Kristin:
Right, like we put up with quirks, like we kind of view the weirdnesses as quirks, not problems.

[00:15:49] Kristin:
Feature, not a bug.

[00:15:51] Drew:
But, uh, the

[00:15:53] Drew:
Issues I think with doing early access is that players can kind of feel like maybe they finished the game

[00:16:00] Kristin:
Mm-hmm.

[00:16:00] Drew:
Because they've hit the end of the content that was available when they were playing in that

[00:16:06] Drew:
You know, that span of time.

[00:16:07] Kristin:
Yes, there seems to be kind of a
[00:16:10] Kristin:
There are two branches, and there's certainly overlap in the game that is just that it's like polished but incomplete.

[00:16:18] Kristin:
So you have like a beautiful first third of the game.

[00:16:21] Kristin:
Versus something that feels more complete but maybe has a lot of gameplay issues.

[00:16:26] Drew:
Yeah, I think for games like Baldur's Gate 3, my understanding is with the alpha players, that's kind of what they got. They got a very polished first third of a game.

[00:16:35] Kristin:
Yeah.

[00:16:36] Drew:
And they were like, this doesn't seem like very much.

[00:16:39] Drew:
And as we now know, they were building a lot more stuff, but they wanted to make sure that the stuff that they were showing people was good.

[00:16:46] Kristin:
Was good and the framework worked appropriately.

[00:16:50] Drew:
Um...

[00:16:51] Kristin:
So another one that is getting a lot of hype right now is Fields of Mysteria.

[00:16:55] Kristin:
Which is another Stardew-type with a very specific look that people really seem to love or be kind of indifferent to, which I am indifferent to, but I guess it's very nostalgic of '90s anime.

[00:17:09] Drew:
Fair enough.

[00:17:10] Kristin:
But it has come out, and people are raving about it, and I think it's pretty well polished, but it's the first

[00:17:17] Kristin:
Third of a game.

[00:17:20] Kristin:
I went ahead and bought it when it was on sale because I was like, yeah, I'm going to like this.

[00:17:25] Kristin:
But I'm not playing it yet because I don't.

[00:17:33] Drew:
And it's interesting because I really think that that first third issue is almost no relation to what the final game will feel like in terms of completeness. Cult of the Lamb, I think, is another good example, where when we first played that when it was in Early Access, I finished it in, I think, about three days.

[00:17:52] Kristin:
Yeah.

[00:17:53] Drew:
I got to the end of the content that was created at that time.

[00:17:56] Drew:
And that felt a little thin.

[00:17:59] Drew:
And then we came back to it this year, and it

[00:18:01] Kristin:
There's an endgame.

[00:18:02] Drew:
Right. There's the endgame. There's plenty to do. You feel really like you've got a complete story by the end.

[00:18:10] Kristin:
And then, I mean, that one still has updates coming out.

[00:18:13] Drew:
Absolutely.

[00:18:14] Drew:
The game that jumps to my mind for kind of handling early access best

[00:18:21] Drew:
Is one called Dead Cells.

[00:18:23] Kristin:
Oh, okay.

[00:18:23] Drew:
Which everybody who's involved in the sort of

[00:18:27] Drew:
Roguelike action game space really loves.

[00:18:31] Drew:
Um...

[00:18:32] Drew:
That's the one you've frequently seen me playing where it's sort of the pixelated look and you're trying to run it as fast as possible. And that game started out with a complete
[interjection] Kristin: Mm-hmm.

[00:18:44] Drew:
Short story and then just kept elaborating on it more and more so they came out with a very very

[00:18:51] Drew:
Good initial loop and I think maybe that's the key is you have to have a good loop.

[00:18:56] Kristin:
Yeah, that's definitely, I mean, that's part of why Critter Cove is so successful in my mind because

[00:19:02] Kristin:
You constantly can find something to do.

[00:19:05] Drew:
Yeah.

[00:19:05] Kristin:
And like you can pick your objectives in ways that are appealing to you in the moment, just spontaneously, so like

[00:19:13] Kristin:
I'm feeling a little queasy, so I don't feel like diving. Instead, I'm going to build some furniture for around the island or go talk to everybody and see what they're up to. This way, I continue building friendships. Oh yeah, one thing that I don't know is...

[00:19:27] Kristin:
if you can go inside their homes, which is a big thing in Animal Crossing.

[00:19:33] Kristin:
And...

[00:19:36] Kristin:
Like in Stardew Valley, once you reach a certain point of friendship, then you can go in their home.

[00:19:41] Kristin:
I don't know if that's the case here, but some of the interior decor stuff talks about how you can decorate your or your friend's house, and I'm like...

[00:19:50] Kristin:
Can I? So I would like to know. And if anybody does know, please tell me. I want to know. I could just go ask in their Discord, but it feels like cheating.
[interjection] Drew: Aww!
[interjection] Kristin: Also, I know they're being inundated with bug reports at the moment. So I don't want to be like, "Hey, hey, hey, hey, can I do this?"
[interjection] Drew: Hey!
[interjection] Kristin: So, back to early access, another one that we've done a lot of is Klei Entertainment's games, like Oxygen Not Included. And I've talked quite a bit about Mindustry this year.

[00:20:23] Kristin:
And that one seems to be kind of a mix of the two. Like...

[00:20:29] Kristin:
Is this a third of a game, or is this sort of gameplay testing? And I don't know. I don't remember enough about Oxygen Not Included.

[00:20:42] Kristin:
And I wasn't skilled enough to make it to what was endgame at the time, but you played more of that.

[00:20:47] Drew:
Yeah, when we first started playing Oxygen Not Included, I don't think you could even actually, like, get out of the asteroid. There was no top to reach.
[interjection] Kristin: There's no top bridge.
[interjection] Drew: Yeah. And then...

[00:20:58] Drew:
I think they kind of called it 1.0 when you could leave, you could get to the top of the
[interjection] Kristin: Oh, okay.
[interjection] Drew: asteroid, and now I think you can go on to additional asteroids.

[00:21:05] Kristin:
Yeah, that's kind of my understanding. I really do need to revisit that one.

[00:21:09] Kristin:
Fully supported on Steam Deck, but I need to...

[00:21:12] Kristin:
relearn how to play the game before I try it on handheld. And Mindustry, again,
[interjection] Drew: Right.
[interjection] Kristin: I haven't played enough to get to

[00:21:20] Kristin:
late game,

[00:21:21] Kristin:
even really mid-game, but it's constantly being patched. I'm seeing notes and stuff all the time.

[00:21:28] Kristin:
Um...

[00:21:29] Kristin:
which is great, and I really enjoy reading the patch notes.

[00:21:32] Drew:
Um, I was trying to remember, Banished?

[00:21:35] Kristin:
Yeah.

[00:21:36] Kristin:
I think it was, but I played a lot of hours of Banished, and I don't remember ever noticing any differences.

[00:21:43] Kristin:
So.

[00:21:44] Drew:
I wonder, again, if it's maybe a little bit easier to hide it in games without a sort of concrete story in the same way.

[00:21:51] Kristin:
Yeah, probably.

[00:21:52] Drew:
Yeah, so it might be easier because you don't notice things are missing until you're kind of told that you can do them.

[00:21:59] Kristin:
Yeah.

[00:22:00] Drew:
Um...

[00:22:01] Drew:
Which, again, kind of gets back to Dwarf Fortress because it's really interesting to look at the evolution of Dwarf Fortress because, you know, it's always been called an Alpha or a Beta or something.

[00:22:12] Kristin:
Right, we'll never have a 1.0 or whatever. Right, right.

[interjection] Kristin: Fifty.
As I said, at some point, if I had more free time, I would really make a series of going back and trying each version because that would be so...

[00:22:29] Kristin:
That would be so cool, yeah.

[00:22:31] Drew:
He's got them all archived on the website. And I was able to run, kind of, the...

[00:22:36] Drew:
I think the second earliest one.

[00:22:39] Drew:
With no real problems, and it's just kind of amazing again how...

[00:22:44] Drew:
Rough that was, but also that the core gameplay loop was there. You got the idea of what...

[00:22:52] Drew:
Dwarf Fortress was going to be like.

[00:22:54] Kristin:
Yeah.

[00:22:55] Drew:
And then he just kept elaborating on it. I think that's the way to go.

[00:22:58] Kristin:
Yeah, and I mean, we do see that now where games are complete, like Stardew Valley, and then they get elaborated on, as you say.

[00:23:08] Kristin:
I feel...

[00:23:09] Kristin:
Kind of spoiled compared to when, you know, I was 10 and I bought a game at Best Buy, and that was what I had.

[00:23:15] Drew:
Yeah, there were no updates. It reminded me of the game from the 90s I really loved called Outpost.

[00:23:21] Kristin:
Yeah, I remember you talking about that one.

[00:23:23] Drew:
Yeah, I absolutely loved that game, which was basically you were creating, it was completely like player against the environment, there were no hostile enemies or anything like that.

[00:23:33] Kristin:
Yeah.

[00:23:34] Drew:
And you're just settling a planet and keeping everybody alive against a hostile environment.

[00:23:40] Drew:
Anyway.

[00:23:41] Drew:
When it was released, um...

[00:23:44] Drew:
It's an interesting game because it was sort of released in a little bit of a beta...

[00:23:49] Drew:
Early access state.

[00:23:51] Drew:
Um...

[00:23:52] Drew:
The challenge, the problem was that they didn't sell it as such.

[00:23:58] Drew:
Again in the 90s because the concept wasn't really there. So they sent out what I think now would be called an early access version to
[interjection] Kristin: version 2.
[interjection] Drew: PC game reviewers who all reviewed it extremely highly because it was amazing.

[00:24:10] Kristin:
Yeah.

[00:24:12] Drew:
But then when the game actually was sold to people as a complete game, it was still that early access version, essentially.

[00:24:20] Drew:
Um, and everybody was like, this is bugged to all hell.

[00:24:23] Drew:
Because there were things like, you know, it's a futuristic city builder. The monorail from settlement to settlement didn't work. You couldn't have multiple settlements, which was one of the selling points on the back of the box.
[interjection] Kristin: Thanks for watching.
[interjection] Drew: You couldn't...

[00:24:38] Drew:
You could...

[00:24:39] Kristin:
Like season three, which I adored, and...

[00:24:41] Kristin:
There was no...

[00:24:43] Kristin:
Battle?

[00:24:44] Drew:
Merc.

[00:24:44] Kristin:
I don't know if it ever worked, but anyway, carry on.

[00:24:47] Drew:
No, and, um, you know, the sort of the end game of Outpost was that you were supposed to be building space colonies up above. Yeah.

[00:24:57] Drew:
And to do that, you would need to have mass drivers, which are the things that you know you can shoot...

[00:25:03] Drew:
Made blocks of metal and stuff up into the...

[00:25:07] Drew:
And yeah, that didn't work.

[00:25:08] Kristin:
Oh, man.

[00:25:09] Drew:
That didn't exist. You couldn't build it. It would crash if you tried to build it.

[00:25:12] Kristin:
Oh my gosh.

[00:25:12] Drew:
Um
And that actually resulted in the kind of downfall of the PC game review industry as an industry in the '90s because everybody was so 

[00:25:25] Kristin:
so hyped about it, and then it...

[00:25:26] Drew:
It was so buggy. 
[interjection] Kristin: Yes.
[interjection] Drew: It's just, you have to set expectations. I think that is the key when you're doing these early access things. 
[interjection] Kristin: That is the key to what I'm doing.

[00:25:36] Kristin:
Well, and by contrast, you have to think about something like No Man's Sky, which I guess was dreadful when it came out, and I don't know if it was early access, was it? 

[00:25:45] Drew:
I don't think they called it early access. 

[00:25:47] Kristin:
Yeah, and it's basically a completely different and very good game now. 

[00:25:52] Kristin:
And it's still getting updated. 

[00:25:54] Drew:
Yeah, and unfortunately, all the different options for game releases have kind of blended together because you have like 
[interjection] Kristin: You can see that.

[00:26:00] Drew:
the alpha, the beta, the early access, the pre-release, 
[interjection] Kristin: Yeah.
[interjection] Drew: and nobody's entirely sure what any of that means because, again, with typos, that used to be considered an alpha. 

[00:26:13] Kristin:
Right. 

[00:26:14] Kristin:
And now...

[00:26:15] Kristin:
It doesn't seem to be. No. And I mean, some of these things are like...

[00:26:20] Kristin:
the developers are not necessarily native English speakers, and that comes up. 

[00:26:26] Drew:
But, I mean, when push comes to shove, though, once you're starting to accept money for something, then, you know, you've got to be able to say that the core gameplay loop is there. 
[interjection] Kristin: Mm-hmm.
[interjection] Drew: And I feel like with Critter Croak...

[00:26:38] Kristin:
It's really hard, right? Yeah, it is really hard. 

[00:26:39] Drew:
With Critter Cove. 

[00:26:43] Drew:
Um, I think you're right that the core gameplay loop is definitely there. 

[00:26:46] Kristin:
Yes, I absolutely feel that way. 

[00:26:48] Drew:
And they're also not asking for much there, it's...

[00:26:50] Kristin:
It's 20 bucks, I think. Yeah, it's 20 bucks. 

[interjection] Kristin: 25
[00:26:51] Drew:

[interjection] Drew: So that's about...

[00:26:55] Kristin:
That's about what I expected, and I think that if you guys remember when Fae Farm came out, I really loved it. 

[00:27:01] Kristin:
And they were charging like $45 for it, and it...

[00:27:04] Kristin:
wasn't, it was buggy. It was like, I think, akin to Critter Cove. Maybe looking a little bit...

[00:27:11] Kristin:
Pretty, I'm using air quotes, "prettier,"

[00:27:15] Kristin:
more polished. I don't know, but it's using that graphics engine that they all use. Yeah. So like it looks the same as a lot of other games, but it's not, they made it very clear that it's not a live service game. So they're not patching typos as they find them. 

[00:27:36] Drew:
Which is weird. It's weird in this day and age, especially when everyone is on Steam, so you can just push out an update, and people don't even notice. 

[00:27:44] Kristin:
I think it's partly because it was co-released on Switch, and it's really hard to patch things on Nintendo, I guess. 

[00:27:50] Drew:
I guess you have to go through a review process. 

[00:27:53] Kristin:
Yeah, but a dedicated dev does that. Yeah. 

[00:27:58] Drew:
And it seems like the Critter Cove people are keen to really do those updates and make this work. 

[00:28:05] Kristin:
I mean, I pointed out a persistent typo when I typed up my early thoughts for them, and like, the next time I played, it was fixed. 

[00:28:11] Kristin:
Which is kind of amazing to me, so. 
[interjection] Drew: Mm-hmm.
[00:28:14] Drew:
Also means they've actually engineered the back end of the game well, because I'm guessing that it's all in one file, that they can just go through and do a find-replace in matching places. 
[interjection] Kristin: You're going to do a find and replace.
[interjection] Drew: Anyway, that's just insider baseball. 

[00:28:28] Kristin:
Oh, I mean, people, I think.

[00:28:29] Kristin:
That our listeners are probably into the insider baseball. I want to pull up their roadmap a little bit.

[00:28:34] Kristin:
Um

[00:28:35] Kristin:
Just to talk about some of the features that they're bringing to the game, so like

[00:28:41] Kristin:
The first update they have an enchanted biome, new locations, robot-helpers, quest lines.

[00:28:48] Kristin:
More crafting updates, an additional wing for the museum, a gift shop.

[00:28:53] Kristin:
Controller remapping, which

[00:28:55] Kristin:
I'm not

[00:28:56] Kristin:
People love to be able to remap, as evidenced by me playing the Diablo PTR. And every single time that I load it up, I have to remap my controller buttons.

[00:29:11] Drew:
I just, I don't understand why that is still persistent in their PTR. And also, I want.

[00:29:17] Kristin:
I want to scream into the void that it is not a small indie company.

[00:29:21] Drew:
My guess is that they have what's called a feature freeze or a change freeze on the PTR, but they've been, they've been patching other stuff on
[interjection] Kristin: On them.
[interjection] Drew: The PTR.

[00:29:29] Kristin:
It's had at least one patch. Yeah, I don't know, but that's it. It's been absolutely maddening.
[interjection] Drew: Yeah.
[interjection] Kristin: Um, a big bakery, which I'm excited about because I think it's going to be really cute.

[00:29:39] Kristin:
A gym, which is adorable, more bug fixes, and polish.

[00:29:44] Drew:
What's the museum? That was a big deal in Animal Crossing, right?

[00:29:47] Kristin:
Yeah, um, so as you find things, usually they're not all things that are crafting materials, so like

[00:29:55] Kristin:
Shells and resources like that, you will donate one to the museum, but you also find little artifacts.

[00:30:02] Kristin:
Most recently, I found, I think, an antique vase.

[00:30:07] Kristin:
Gave that to them. And I found other things like that. So, it's kind of fun.

[00:30:11] Kristin:
You have to rescue a woolly mammoth curator and bring her back.

[00:30:16] Drew:
At some point, we have to rewatch the Idea Channel episode, "Is Animal Crossing an Example of Otaku Citizenship?"
[interjection] Kristin: Yes!
[interjection] Drew: Because I forget what exactly he meant by that, but I don't super feel... I feel like Critter Cove is doing something different than that.

[00:30:32] Kristin:
I mean

[00:30:34] Kristin:
I'm thinking, like, I will obviously trim the long pause there.

[00:30:38] Kristin:
It is and it isn't because you are still contributing to town wellness.

[00:30:44] Kristin:
And that's the point, but there is also that sort of

[00:30:48] Kristin:
Exploration element that Animal Crossing doesn't have.

[00:30:53] Kristin:
Yeah.

[00:30:54] Drew:
Because I feel like Stardew Valley, part of the idea there is it's more individual-focused. You help the town, but it's still very much a sort of capitalist idea of you're improving
[interjection] Kristin: The town.
[interjection] Drew: Things to make your life better rather than other people's.

[00:31:07] Kristin:
You do get upgrades and bonuses from fixing up the community center.

[00:31:13] Kristin:
Whereas the museum in Stardew Valley, you get little bonuses, but they're not very big. I don't know if there are bonuses for
The Critter Cove Museum, like, I will admit that with getting no bonuses from a museum in Animal Crossing, I'm pretty bad about it. I'm failing at my museum, like, finding all the fish and stuff, like, yeah, I don't care.

[00:31:34] Drew:
Are you saying you're not good at otaku citizenship? I am.

[00:31:36] Kristin:
I am a bad citizen, yes.
[interjection] Drew: Yeah.

[00:31:41] Kristin:
Like, if you don't reward me, am I gonna do it? Mmm, probably not.

[00:31:48] Drew:
No comment.

[00:31:49] Kristin:
Yeah, uh, so I think that covers it. Was there anything else from when you were playing it that you wanted to add or observations of me playing it?

[00:31:58] Drew:
No, I think that's about it. The controls felt pretty good.

[00:32:02] Kristin:
Oh, I just answered one of my own questions. The clinic is coming in update two.

[00:32:08] Drew:
Nice.

[00:32:09] Kristin:
So that's that. I will be able to accidentally kill myself to my heart's content.

[00:32:15] Drew:
And get repaired.

[00:32:16] Kristin:
Yeah.

[00:32:18] Kristin:
Oh, and home visits are on there too, so I apparently should have just looked at the infographic for the updates more closely.

[00:32:23] Drew:
Before we started recording.

[00:32:30] Kristin:
Man, fun games! So, like I said, their roadmap is really ambitious. I would like to see dates, but I'm going to stay tuned into the game and the community.

[00:32:40] Kristin:
I would really love to stream it more.

[00:32:42] Kristin:
But, um...

[00:32:44] Kristin:
Man, that was a rough time for me.

[00:32:46] Drew:
Yeah, well, we just gotta drug you up beforehand.

[00:32:48] Kristin:
Yeah, I did take motion sickness meds for four of the five first days that I was playing, and then I was like, okay, that's not sustainable. So now I just play in small chunks. So, yeah.
[interjection] Drew: It's a non-sustainable scenario.

[00:33:02] Drew:
No, I think that's about it. I don't really have any other early access games I've played that spring to mind, so I think...

[00:33:09] Kristin:
Yeah, I think that covers it. I do have a code to give away.

[00:33:13] Kristin:
If any of our listeners would like to have that, I don't really have a good way to give it away because I don't necessarily know if

[00:33:21] Kristin:
Dwarf Fortress fans are going to want to play it, but if you do, I guess the first person
[interjection] Drew: if they
[interjection] Kristin: to contact me can have that code.

[00:33:28] Drew:
Yep, but probably after...

[00:33:30] Drew:
Three or four days after this comes out, you'll probably give it away in

[00:33:33] Kristin:
My admin, a Final Fantasy XIV community server.

[00:33:39] Kristin:
And those people will be very excited. Yeah, that'll be gone in a minute. So you've got three or four days. Yeah, I'll do an actual giveaway, like with a bot choosing a number on that one, if that one happens. So if you or a loved one would like it, then hurry up and email us at estrangemoodpodcast@gmail.com.

[00:33:58] Drew:
That's probably the right email address.

[00:33:59] Kristin:
That's probably the right email. It's like a treasure hunt.

[00:34:02] Drew:
Exactly.

[00:34:03] Drew:
But, yeah, until next time, just keep digging!
