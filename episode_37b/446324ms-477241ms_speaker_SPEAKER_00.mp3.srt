Oh, no, without kingshame. Okay, so to explain the tourism thing, because one of my criticisms

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,400
of this game is that some of the mechanics are not necessarily taught to you by the game,

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,879
and so I know what I am about to describe, because one of the devs told us in the Discord.

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:28,480
But so you attract tourists once you get the basics of your town up and running,

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,639
and I guess that in
