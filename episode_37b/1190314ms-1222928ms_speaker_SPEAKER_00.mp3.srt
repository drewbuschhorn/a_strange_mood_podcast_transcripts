1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,120
Can I?

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,560
So I would like to know.

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,840
And if anybody does know, please tell me.

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,480
I want to know.

5
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,080
I could just go ask in their Discord,

6
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,480
but it feels like cheating.

7
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,800
Also, I know they're being inundated with bug reports

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,400
at the moment.

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,280
So I don't want to be like, hey, hey, hey, hey, can I do this?

10
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,879
Can I do this?

11
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:23,600
So back to early access, another one that we've done a lot of

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,920
is clay games, so oxygen not included.

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,759
And I've talked quite a bit about Mind Over Magic this year.
