1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,120
and then they're unhappy and they won't make stuff.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,040
And so, you know, it's a vicious cycle.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,200
But we also started cooking some meals.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,360
I realized that I didn't have a kitchen.

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,720
So for all I know, they're eating raw snails and fruit.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,840
So now we're cooking some fine meals actually.

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,680
Well, that's good.

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,520
Yeah.
