Ragdreens. The dramas of a well-run fort are still similar to the dramas of a

00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,780
poorly run fort, which is what Ragdreens is turning into. So as you recall from

turn some of our dwarves into zombies. So now we have quite a few friendly

00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,180
zombies wandering around. Everyone is extremely unhappy. I don't think it's
