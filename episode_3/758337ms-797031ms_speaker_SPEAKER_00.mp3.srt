00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,220
Well, mine are across the hallway from the temple, which seems...

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,220
Appropriate.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,120
Yeah, you know, you go pray, you go think about your dead friends.

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:13,620
And unfortunately that hasn't really helped, the memorializing, I mean.

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,940
But I'm also trying some more practical things, like lots of engraving, lots of smoothing,

6
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:23,000
putting down some floors here and there to make things pretty, because, you know, dwarves

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,320
like things to be pretty.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,320
And I've improved some bedrooms, both with the engraving and floors, and then I think

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,320
I added a chest to a few bedrooms so that they have more place to store their stuff.

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,720
Although some of them are unhappy because they haven't gotten any new stuff for a while.
