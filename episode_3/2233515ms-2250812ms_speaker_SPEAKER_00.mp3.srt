00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
No, that was the os, the os.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm just gonna say it every possible way to make sure I have all my basses covered.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
That makes sense.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yeah, so I should put the os out somewhere.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We have some musical instruments here and there, but are they supposed to play the instruments?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Because I never see it happen. I put them in taverns and it never happens.
