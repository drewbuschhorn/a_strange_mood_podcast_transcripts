00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,800
reverse apartment blocks, right, or underground apartment blocks, where instead of having a central hallway for each level,

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,680
you just have central shalves for each group of rooms.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,680
And so they just go down through each other's rooms to get to their own room.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,780
And I'm like, this seems like it would be awkward, but it works in Dwarf Fortress, and it's an important layout

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,600
consideration, all of Dwarf Fortress, that going up and down stairs in Dwarf Fortress, one single step

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,600
back.
