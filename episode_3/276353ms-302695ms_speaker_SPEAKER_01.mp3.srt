1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
You just dispatch them off.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,240
Yeah, so you just have to...

3
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:02,880
Good luck guys!

4
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,440
Exactly. Sometimes they come back, sometimes they don't.

5
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,160
Right.

6
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,240
And the funny part about the Goblin Pit, Doomfield, is that we raised it,

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,800
but afterwards it became economically linked with us, so it still existed.

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,120
And also now it's listed as having a population of 50,

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,080
whereas before it had a population of approximately 20.

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,600
I don't really understand how this works.

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:30,960
I think it's part of Dwarf Fortress's magic.
