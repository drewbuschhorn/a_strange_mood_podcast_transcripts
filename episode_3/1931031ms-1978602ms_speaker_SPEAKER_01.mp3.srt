00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
I usually have a resource pile near the entrance and that holds like the very

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:14,800
rawest of things like wood and meat or whatever. And then I frequently make a very big hollowed

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:21,680
out resource pile in like the first kind of real round layer frequently that's maybe third or fourth

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:29,760
z level down. I just hollow out a big cube, whatever's the easiest to

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:37,040
select with my mouse in order to get a lot of rock available there from mining it. And then also

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,760
then just designate that whole thing as like a finished goods pile. And so that way everything

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,440
that people build they just you know take three steps down, chuck something in there,

8
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:58,880
and then walk three steps back up and get back to work.
