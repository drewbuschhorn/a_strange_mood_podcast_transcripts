1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Not the D&D dungeon master.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Oh, okay.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Or the other one.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You're going somewhere else completely.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
But I tell you all these facts about Lore so you can understand his main rival in the Fort,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
which is our new Baron and formerly Chief Medical Dwarf, Ushat Seedlabored.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
He was made Baron while Lore Goldenwhip was off on the attack on Doomfeat,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Goblin Pit Doomfeat, and we got promoted.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Partly as a result of that fight, partly as a result of settling the Dwarven Hillock,

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and he was chosen to become Baron, Ushat Seedlabored.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
As time has gone on, those two have developed a rivalry.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Partly, this is because of religious differences.
