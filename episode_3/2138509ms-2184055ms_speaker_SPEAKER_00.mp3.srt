00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Yeah, that's not even my favorite artifact that we got. We also got a Kaolinite crown

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,080
that is encrusted with Kaolinite cabochons and oval moonstone cabochons, which sounds pretty.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,400
Moonstones, love moonstones. On the item is an image of Obscuracalls the Rainy, the dwarf,

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,080
in moonstone. Obscuracalls the Rainy is striking a menacing pose. The artwork relates to the return

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,600
of the zombie dwarf hollow slayer Obscuracalls the Rainy from the dead in Ragdreams in the

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:37,280
mid-spring of 110. And you know, I went through the dead and the current residents looking for

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,200
Obscuracalls the Rainy. I couldn't find him, but clearly it's someone who died in the massacre,

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:01:01,680
so I'll have to hunt for him a little bit more.
