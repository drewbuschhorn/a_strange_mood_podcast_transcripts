1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,540
But I like the idea of trying to make some of my forts a little prettier.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,700
And remember, I went through that whole thing where I was like,

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,600
what's that pink rock?

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,280
And I had to go through and find what was pink and try to make doors and things

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,940
out of the pink rock just to make it pretty.

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,640
So I didn't have enough of whichever one I was using.

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,140
Yeah, I think that's rock crystal.

8
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,420
I could have been rock salt. Rock salt. Rock salt.

9
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,380
Right. Rock crystal.

10
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,720
And there's another one that looks pink, but I had some of whatever it was.

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,820
And that was kind of fun.

12
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,860
And then in Lore Copper Leopard's office, I put,

13
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,840
I don't remember which mineral it was, but it like blue flooring.

14
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,080
And it's really very pretty.

15
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,080
Oh, that sounds nice.
