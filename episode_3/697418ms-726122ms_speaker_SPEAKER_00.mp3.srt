1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
It's hard to identify which one it is.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,080
So, uh, I don't blame them for being unhappy,

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,080
but I've been trying to make them happier.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,440
I've been trying to make them happier,

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,480
including by, uh, engraving memorial slabs,

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,520
building coffins.

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,520
We have a lot of empty coffins, though,

8
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,960
and skeletons sitting around,

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,080
and they're not, you know, connecting those dots.

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,800
I'm not sure why the skeletons are still just out rotting,

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,000
but here we are.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,880
And then the sort of sub-problem to all this

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,000
is that now we are getting ghosts.
