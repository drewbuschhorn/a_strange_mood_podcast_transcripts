1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
She's very proud of herself.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,280
On the other hand, we have our manager,

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,680
we're gonna name him Monk Wheels,

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,080
and he is, he's my lore.

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,040
He is constantly angry.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,880
I gave him a nice office, like lots of upgrades, flooring.

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,920
No, he's still mad.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,760
He just walks around being grumpy all the time.

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,160
And then I realized when I was doing some just basic stuff

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,880
that every workshop I went to

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,680
and gave like a one-off, one or two task,

12
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,960
he was the one going and doing it.

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,720
So he's walking around feeling put upon,

14
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,600
but then he's the one volunteering for all this work

15
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:58,160
when we have other idle dwarves who could be doing it.
