I'm a pretty big fan of slightly more defensible designs like one of my favorite tricks is to build a tavern

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,040
right at the entrance of the

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,520
Fort so that way all of our foreign

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:20,840
Visitors and all those things today. Yeah, exactly. They serve as meat shields when an actual is there comes

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,840
It's easier a bit to do that. Once it once the fort is up and running because

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,680
Having all those people around kind of blocks the hauling things in and out when you're first like having to do a lot of

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:41,160
Gathering and woodcutting and all that but once things kind of settle down there and you're more getting your resources from the caverns

8
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,200
You can rezone that whole entrance as a base
