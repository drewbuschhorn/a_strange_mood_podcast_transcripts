00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
I think that's not inconvenient.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,120
Yeah, it's always a toss up for me

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,800
whether or not I put my hospital near the living quarters

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,600
or down, pretty far down towards the caverns

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,440
where all the fighting happens.

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:29,800
I would make.
