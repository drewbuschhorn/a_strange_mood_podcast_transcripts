It is kind of funny to watch the dwarves on your super new laptop because the frame, we don't have frame rate limiting in Dwarf Fortress much right now.

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And you can control that guys, like you can, I think you can hit period maybe to slow down the frame rate some, but yeah, it's hard to set and I guess we all just let it run as best it can.
