00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,240
So you can dig in kind of a dry area around the aquifer and then like do channel in order to

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:16,320
get the water to drain over there into that drain. The other option is to be very frustrated and

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,840
dig each section to get through because even when they refuse to dig somewhere,

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:30,160
be it because of damp stone or hot stone because lava gives you the same thing.
