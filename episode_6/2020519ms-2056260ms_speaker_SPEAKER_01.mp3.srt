1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
And make sure no one can walk into it and be shot.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:02,660
Exactly.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:04,960
Yeah, I might.

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:05,760
We have fun here.

5
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,200
Yeah. Shooting each other. So I might try that.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,880
The goblin siege did mean that we didn't get migrants for a little while,

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,000
but this fort is at like 120 dwarves right now.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,720
Jeez.

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,160
And because the goblins were out there, we didn't get our civilization visitors last autumn,

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:33,360
so we are very clearly due a barony. So hopefully I will play some more this week

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:45,200
and that will happen for us. I'm very excited.
