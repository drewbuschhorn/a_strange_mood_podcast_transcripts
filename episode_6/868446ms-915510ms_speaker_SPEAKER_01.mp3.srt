00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
A Sparkle Fort is a, Kristen Turm, TM, TM, TM.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,880
It is a fort in a good zone, good surroundings.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,640
We have not talked about surroundings before, I don't think.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,480
And when you embark, you choose a sort of tone of your zone.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,240
And it has kind of like a D&D alignment chart, maybe that makes sense to some other nerdy

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,120
people, in which you can have good, neutral, and evil locations.

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,920
And then they are divided up by how calm they are.

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,360
So a benign location has like not a lot of attack, there's not a lot of aggro in the

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,780
environment.

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,120
Neutral is neutral.

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,120
And savage means super aggro.

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:59,800
So you can have savage good, in which case you might get murdered by unicorns.
