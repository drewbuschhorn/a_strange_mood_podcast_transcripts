00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
Oh, that's interesting.

00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,160
I only have built those things when they request them.

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,800
So I think we have a farmer's and maybe a stone worker's.

00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,080
I also had my first request for a temple.

00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:29,080
And the priest that I appointed is called the Sacred Shell.
