00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
Ooh, good question.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,480
I have a couple of ideas.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,840
There is a tavern keeper, her name is Nish.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,840
I think I might just like her because her sprite is really, really cute.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,920
But also, she was one of the many dwarves that have had babies in this fort.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,480
So I checked her out and she was very happy about being a parent and she is enjoying being

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,560
a tavern keeper and she is married.

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,680
Her husband is funny because in his thoughts he is uneasy at having gotten married and

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,160
has a lover who is uneasy at being with him and he seems to be uneasy at being with the

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,240
lover.

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:55,760
It seems like quite the tangled mess.
