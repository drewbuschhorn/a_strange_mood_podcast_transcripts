1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
that sort of thing.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Right.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,840
It's interesting because I didn't look at the metals present at my location at all.

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,640
And while we have a fair bit of silver and a little bit of gold, I haven't really seen

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,200
a lot of platinum.

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:18,980
I have a lot of the iron ore things, but I, and it took, it took me a long time to find

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,140
the more valuable metals.

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,720
We had a lot of gems, really shallow, not a lot of high value gems.

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,760
So not, not as many diamonds and emeralds and things like that.
