00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,520
So an aquifer in real life is a patch of ground that has water within it.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,800
And so like if you were to dig down with your hands, it would slowly start to seep and fill up

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:21,840
that hole that you've dug with the water. Dwarf Fortress replicates this by when making an

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:29,520
embark zone, it will decide that some regions have this water and some number of Z levels.

5
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:38,480
So it's basically like a cloud in the ground full of water. The challenge is that that zone,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,400
the stone or dirt that is wet inside there that's damp,

7
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:59,920
will continue leaking forever if you don't excavate it completely.
