I've lost two to Feymoods. One because something else was happening in the Fort and I forgot

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,940
about him. Because I usually try to babysit them to make sure they have what they need.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,800
So I don't even know what he needed. And the other guy, I was watching his needs and I

00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,800
was trying to accommodate them. I made rock blocks. We actually had rock blocks. He needed...

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,920
One was tree life. And I have assumed that's wood because I've seen that with other dwarves

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,400
and they find whatever it is. Wasn't that. So maybe there was another one that I'm not

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,080
remembering. But he died.
