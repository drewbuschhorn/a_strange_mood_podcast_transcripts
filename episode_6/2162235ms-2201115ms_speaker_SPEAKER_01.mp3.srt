1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
about the sizes of clothing.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Right, like they can't wear human clothing.

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,560
And those are always marked as large.

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,920
So it seems like there would be small silk trousers.

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,440
It just sounds so cute.

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,820
Speaking of silk though, we've gone through two mayors.

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,560
I don't remember who the first one was,

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,080
but they weren't in office very long.

9
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,320
And the dwarves have now elected,

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,140
I think two or three times.

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,600
Carol, the legendary weaver,

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,240
and she spends most of her time weaving

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,120
masterpiece cave silk cloth.

14
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,760
And I guess sometimes she takes meetings.

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,040
She has quite a nice office

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:01:00,040
with engraved marble floors that I made her, but yeah.
