1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,620
Yeah, you can definitely get down through there.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,920
Although sometimes there are multiple layers of aquifer.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,680
There's also light aquifer and heavy aquifer.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,440
Light aquifer is what we're dealing with

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,480
and it's pretty easy to work around using those tricks.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,440
Don't start an embark with a heavy aquifer.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,640
Is it just flooding?

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,320
It basically is like digging into a pressurized spring

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,320
or something.

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,920
It will just gush.

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,760
That's funny.

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,840
They flood your fortress.
