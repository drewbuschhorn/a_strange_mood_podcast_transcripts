1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
Okay, I did do that.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,240
That seemed to stop some of the seepage.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,280
We still have a little bit in a couple of places.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,600
I'm not entirely sure where it's coming from.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,400
Also, now that I'm talking,

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,320
I'm realizing I never clicked on those puddles

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,300
and they look like water,

8
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,160
but they could be some other fluid

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,000
or have gotten there from one of the many buckets

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
the dwarves are carrying around.
