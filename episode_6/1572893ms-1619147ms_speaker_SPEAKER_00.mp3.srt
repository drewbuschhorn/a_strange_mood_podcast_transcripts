00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
So there's usually, I forget what it, I can't remember if it's metal or like light metal,

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,560
something like that, that basically means you will find metal in the first 10 layers or so.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:19,520
Deep metal means you're going to be down like 20 below the Z zero, so negative 20 or something

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:26,640
like that, which is usually 60-ish levels from where you start before you'll, or not necessarily

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,400
before you'll find metal, but before you'll find large seams of it. That's pretty good usually in

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:40,240
my view because that's frequently where you'll start to find like zinc and copper, gold and

7
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:58,960
silver. Usually the higher levels are just iron, some copper, that sort of thing.
