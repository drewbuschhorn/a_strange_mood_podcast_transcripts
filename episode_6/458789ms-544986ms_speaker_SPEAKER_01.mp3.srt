1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
sometimes I feel like that the number of zombies seemed to increase.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,160
So maybe the necromancer didn't leave immediately.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,080
But, um, I decided I wasn't ready to just abandon rag dreams.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,600
Um, even though the traders and guests and things obviously couldn't make it.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:21,000
So we were just closed in with the extremely overpowered hatch in the ground

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,080
that kept anything from getting in.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,280
Um, so I got the idea to build a bunch of cage traps surrounding the staircase.

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,440
And then I would open the top hatch, let the zombies into that level with a hatch

9
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,920
to keep them from going lower.

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,320
And, um, then we deal with them in batches and take them off and drop

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,840
them into magma or whatever, whatever you do with zombies.

12
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,640
Um, but then I realized that, um, they, they weren't like opening

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,760
the hatch and coming in anyway.

14
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,640
I kind of had to beat them with some dwarves, which was terrible, but, um,

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,560
I was willing to accept the sacrifice.

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:01:00,520
So I opened the hatches, um, and then found out that the, um, the, the cage

17
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,600
traps were around the stairs and the zombies just zoomed right down the

18
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,480
stairs without ever getting trapped.

19
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,400
As this was going on, the internet was dropping repeatedly and I was struggling

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,520
to see that it was dropping because the software that I was using for Twitch

21
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,360
was not telling me when it was dropping.

22
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,240
And I had no idea.

23
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,800
So I'd just be happily talking up here to myself and you would have to come

24
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,280
up into my studio and say, Hey, by the way, that, that stream dropped again.
