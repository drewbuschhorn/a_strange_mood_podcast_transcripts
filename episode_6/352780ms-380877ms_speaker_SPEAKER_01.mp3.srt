00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Yeah, so we're gonna have to figure that out. I mean, it didn't help that I did stream for a couple hours last week,

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,760
so I had a lot of dwarfing time then, and I think it was Sunday, maybe Saturday, I sat down and was like,

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,440
oh, I'm gonna, you know, I have a couple of things I want to take care of in the fort, and like three hours later,

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,280
I stood up and was like, oh, my mouse hand hurts.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,280
So that, I was very dwarfish in that way, because I had a need to play Dwarf Fortress,

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:30,080
and then I did it until I was in physical pain.
