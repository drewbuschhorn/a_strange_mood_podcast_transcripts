1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
No, because I have a fisher dwarf fishing in the caverns.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,760
That was the next thing I was gonna say

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,480
is I hit cavern really, really early.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,180
I think that it's only, it might be like negative 10,

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,440
and I only started at like a four, plus four.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,000
So I hit cavern really early.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It had lots of fungus.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,420
It had water.

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,480
So I immediately plopped down a bunch of farms,

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,040
put all the animals in the caverns,

11
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,440
cut down a bunch of mushroom trees,

12
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,920
started fishing, and we were good to go.

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,120
The other really odd thing is that we have not come across

14
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,520
any cavern dwellers.

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,360
Well, that's nice.

16
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,840
Yeah, and I don't know if it's because

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,840
some of the cavern I haven't accessed.

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,720
So my openings are just not connected

19
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,720
to the caverns in that way.

20
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,220
And maybe in this shallow cavern

21
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,280
where we're just ran amok, there's none.

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,100
It could be that.

23
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,400
And as I had been chasing down metals and things,

24
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,120
I've been really careful to leave a wall

25
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,160
between the cavern and where we're going

26
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,560
so that I don't end up with the constant Batman

27
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,120
sieging from within,

28
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:28,120
because that can be really a pain.
