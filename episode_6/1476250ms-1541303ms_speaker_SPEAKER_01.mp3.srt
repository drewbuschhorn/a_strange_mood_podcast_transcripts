1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Fair enough.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,800
So that's the water element.

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:09,720
The other thing that I wanted to talk about a little bit was choosing your location visually

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,320
rather than necessarily scanning for things that you want.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,240
I put down my embark location sort of in the crook of a Y of a brook.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,440
I was like, oh, we'll have plenty of good water streams.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,240
And I've had good luck with fishing being a primary food source.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,160
And then you get all the shells and it's a good starting industry.

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,560
But when I got into the embark location, it was like just a black screen because it put

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,880
them in like this teeny little hollow in the midst of a bunch of hills, which at first

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,600
was just like, oh, no, what have I done?

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,840
But then I realized I just tunneled sideways into the hill and it was totally it was in

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,200
some ways easier.

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,520
But I was a little bit worried about caravans and things getting to us, especially because

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,400
for me, at least the good location was really far from most of the Dwarven civilizations.

16
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,680
Like my nearest neighbors are elves and more elves and more elves.

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:24,680
The elves are.
