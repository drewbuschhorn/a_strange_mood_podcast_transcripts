1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
Alas, we also have the end of Daupt Pages.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,040
Alas.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,000
While we were digging out the volcanic wall

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,620
we talked about last time,

5
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,600
with plenty of gems and exciting gifts from the gods

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,640
to be found in there worth all sorts of money,

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,240
under the direction of our Countess,

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,740
three dwarves have burned to ash.

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,760
But in the course of that,

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,240
we found another 200,000 dwarf bucks

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,160
of treasures of the gods.

12
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,320
And at one point, hundreds of adamantite wafers,

13
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,040
I'm not sure if I'm saying adamantite quite right.

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:32,880
Sounds like-
