It was fun. It was fun. But the Twitch streaming has been kind of a trip. Like I've never done

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:13,200
it before. And the first time I did, I think it was the first time, I kept losing my internet

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:21,360
connection. I was trying to deal with the zombie problem in Ragdreams. And it just it

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:27,720
just kept dropping. And I was getting so mad because if you recall from previous episodes,

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,560
we had had a zombie invasion in which the necromancer just abandoned like 30 zombies

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,320
outside my fort. And then every time we had a visitor, those zombies would kill that visitor.
