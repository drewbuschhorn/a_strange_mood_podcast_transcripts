00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
I can't remember which of the Roundtable guys in either the most recent episode where they

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,920
mentioned us or the one before that talked about running that same thing.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,520
Maybe it was actually at the start of their new season.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,780
They talked about how in the premium version of Dwarf Fortress, you know, it's now designed

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:22,000
to be a mouse-driven game and you do really build up a little bit of mouse carpal tunnel

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:37,320
if you keep going for multiple hours with it.
