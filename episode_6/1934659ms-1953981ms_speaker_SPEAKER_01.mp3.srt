1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
But nothing came of that because I just built a wall.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,000
And in the passing months, got my squad good and trained,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,760
then tore down the wall and took out these,

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,300
I think it was 10 or 12 goblins.

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,800
We lost two dwarves, but for the most part,

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,680
it was really quite easy to take out these goblins.

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:30,240
So no parlay necessary.
