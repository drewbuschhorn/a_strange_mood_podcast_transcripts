1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
I think you can only pick those people.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,720
Yeah, because in order to have a priesthood,

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,480
it must be an organized congregation,

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,920
not just a temple dedicated to a particular god.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,720
It has to be a congregation dedicated to a god.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,200
And then the selection of the priest

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,520
has to be from within that congregation.

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,060
Yeah.
