1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
So you smooth that out, and then you dig fortifications

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,920
so that you basically are digging the gaps

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,080
into the wall there.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:31,080
The water will just flow through that and then off your map.
