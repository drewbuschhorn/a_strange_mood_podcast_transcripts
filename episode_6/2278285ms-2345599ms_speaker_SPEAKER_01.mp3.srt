1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
No, I don't remember. I think the name started with a U, which among dwarves is, you know,

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:12,240
half of them. So the, I guess, I mean, most of everything that's come out of Curlkey has been

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,880
really positive. We have a lot of artifacts, including a table that features engraving of

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,960
boogeymen. Boogeymen, plural. Not just one boogeyman, many boogeymen. And I put that in

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,960
the tavern. They love their tavern. They are always partying in there. We had a minotaur come.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:36,080
It was very scary. You get the little scary beast image notification in the upper left. He came. He

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,560
ran inside before I could stop him and was promptly murdered by someone who just happened

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,840
to be at the trade depot. Huh. He did take out one dwarf and that dwarf's pet bunny.

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,640
Aw. So that was pretty sad. I might carve a slab for the pet bunny. Might as well. Yeah. So I,

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,080
I have to think that maybe the mirthful location is just a little on the easy side.

11
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,840
And there's nothing wrong with that. Danger. Yeah. I'm having a lot of fun,

12
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:28,000
so I might see how far I can get in terms of barony and all that stuff before I leave this one.
