00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
I also want to say that anyone who's not actually encountered the Dwarf Fortress Roundtable,

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:11,280
one, how the hell did you wind up here with us without hearing about them in the first place?

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,120
But if you haven't heard about them, I mean, go find them on your podcast device of choice,

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,400
because they're a great podcast and they've had five years?

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,480
They know so much more than we do.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:22,800
Yeah.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:30,160
Yeah.
