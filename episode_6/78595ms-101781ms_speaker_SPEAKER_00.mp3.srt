00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,420
It's always fun to realize when you're first starting a fort

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,800
that if you don't build the temple early enough,

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,520
the need for religious piety will just keep building

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,620
and building and building for your dwarves

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,220
until when you finally do get around to building a temple

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,140
because they demand one and are unhappy,

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,140
they'll just simply go there and begin worshiping

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:35,980
and never stop for like two years.
