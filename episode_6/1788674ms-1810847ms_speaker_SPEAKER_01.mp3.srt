Well, my new fort is called Curlkey. It's in a mirthful good location at the um the the crook

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:11,440
of this brook, the crook of the brook. Um the brook I have not used at all. So visually I chose it

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,440
based on that and it has not factored into my play at all especially because it's so hilly around

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,520
there that like just looking for the brook and sending dwarves over there it's just it's way

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:32,720
too much work.
