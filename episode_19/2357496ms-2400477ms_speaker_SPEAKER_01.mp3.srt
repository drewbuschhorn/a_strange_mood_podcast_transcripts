1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
the other interesting thing for me with all of it is just being able to figure out why they're all

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,600
connected. It's a little bit of going to hope they get the word right. But our listeners can

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:21,440
see that I'm not as smart as I think I am. pareidolia. I don't know. The seeing faces

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,800
in the clouds. Okay, yeah. So you look at the you, you look at all these different

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,640
things and characteristics that two dwarves are you're trying to figure out why are you

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,160
interested in each other and you look at these things until you find something that works.

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,440
And you know, again, if you're testing a drug, that's not how you want to do things. But if

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,720
you're, you know, making a story, then pareidolia is fine.
