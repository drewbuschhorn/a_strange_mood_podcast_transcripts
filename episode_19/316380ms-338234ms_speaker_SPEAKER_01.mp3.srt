00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Congrats also to the big winner in the betting pool,

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,920
Bralbard, who bet on Dreadhoof two rounds

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,740
before Dreadhoof died,

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,840
then swapped to Logem for the remaining four rounds

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,000
and won each time.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,520
So he wound up with a very nice haul

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,600
of utterly pointless credits.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,640
Congratulations.
