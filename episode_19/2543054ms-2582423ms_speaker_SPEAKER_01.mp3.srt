00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
think most people usually max out at like 10 to 15. It's rare for me to get to 15.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:13,200
And so, I feel like there's not a whole lot of evolution I can see there. Very rarely have I seen

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,400
children become adults. It's relatively rare. We've talked about it once or twice, it happens.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,440
And so, if the time was a little bit faster, if time passed a little bit faster, I feel like

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,480
that might be more interesting to me because you can see dwarves get married, but then also,

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,960
I think it's been pretty rare to actually see dwarves get married and have kids and

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,200
have the kid grow up into an adult dwarf. Yeah, I'll see.
