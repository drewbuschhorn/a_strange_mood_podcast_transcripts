Yeah. And I really, I actually like in terms of romance, seeing like what dwarves will pick each

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:11,920
other and trying to then assign motivations to what they're doing. Because even though dwarves

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,800
have goals, like I've seen, like have a family or create a masterwork and stuff like that.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,880
It's really like, you can't make them fall in love with someone and you can like assign

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,720
them a workshop, I guess, but that doesn't necessarily guarantee that they'll create

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,520
that masterwork.
