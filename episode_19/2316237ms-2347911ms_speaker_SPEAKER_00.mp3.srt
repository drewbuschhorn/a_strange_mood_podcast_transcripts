Yeah, it does make me thinking about role playing. I think partly because we've been

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,200
playing so much Baldur's Gate and then just getting meta about my own story writing.

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,120
It makes me excited for adventure mode because you can take one of those interesting dwarves,

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,880
right? And then just become them. Isn't that how it works? So that's that's kind of cool,

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,480
actually. So I begin, I never really understood why people were so into adventure mode, because

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,440
I'm like, that's not what this game is like. But now that I've seen it, I'm much more curious.
