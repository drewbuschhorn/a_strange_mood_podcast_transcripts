00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
right, will elaborate or come up with Dwarf motivations that they don't have. And I think

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,800
that in one of his behind the scenes, Krug said something about having like multiple branches

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,040
of the same save, in which he can like pursue how a project is going in one direction,

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,640
or if there's like an attack happening, happening simultaneously with a project,

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,320
he can't get footage of both. And so you have to just sort of be like parallel universes.
