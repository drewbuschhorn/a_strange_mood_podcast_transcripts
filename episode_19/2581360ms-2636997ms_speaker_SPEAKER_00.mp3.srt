00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
Yeah, I'll see maybe two of three, or maybe just the married and children pretty frequently.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,240
And I think that I'm probably seeing children age up maybe more often than I think I am,

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:19,360
but those would be children who came to the fort as children, not children that were born at the

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:26,320
fort. I think for me, one of the frustrations is not necessarily being able to create interesting

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:33,040
stories for my pet dwarves. So like the sad child, there wasn't really a way for me to

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,680
make her story interesting again. Like I couldn't directly tell her like,

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,880
why don't you learn a craft or go pray or something like that, or have some dwarf adopt her

8
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,200
or anything like that. I just was waiting for something to happen and nothing was.

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,440
So it does remove a little bit of agency in terms of storytelling.
