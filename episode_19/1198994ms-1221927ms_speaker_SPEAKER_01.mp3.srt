1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
including one who murdered Torchmoisand,

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,240
the one who had just lost her lover,

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,520
so at least we didn't have to deal with that unhappiness,

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,820
while Adair worked in the dye shop.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,920
So Torchmoisand was murdered by a giant osprey

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,480
that had flown into the fort,

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,040
taken a turn, gone over to the dye shop.
