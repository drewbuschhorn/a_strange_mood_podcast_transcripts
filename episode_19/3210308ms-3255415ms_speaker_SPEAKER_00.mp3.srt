1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
Their ascension to the nobility made as little sense as the sudden disappearance of the reptile

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,100
men that had ruined his health and killed so many.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,940
It seemed, sometimes, that whatever divine forces ruled Wet-Ringed, they were as arbitrary

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,060
and thoughtless as the fall of the snow outside.

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,480
He shouldn't question it, he knew, but somehow it deepened his sense of aimlessness.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,380
The purposelessness of it all hung over his mind like a stagnant gray miasma.

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,980
But Ral, glowing with her glorious transformation into royalty, did not notice his malaise.

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:29,980
She nuzzled his beard.

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,100
This will be the start of a new future for us, and for Wet-Ringed.

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,300
Adil forced a smile and squeezed her tightly.

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,700
What do you plan to do with your new power? he asked, trying to sound playful.

12
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,260
Hmm, Ral said.

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,060
Well, I think I'll order the construction of gauntlets.
