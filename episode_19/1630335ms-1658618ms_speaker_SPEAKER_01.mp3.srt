1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,060
I'm like, that sounds like a couple who really know how to get things done.

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:05,560
Yeah.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,620
And so appointing them, because you have the, you have the choice of who to

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:14,860
appoint, um, resulted in some interesting effects I felt like.

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,500
I felt like, um, with a lot of the trading that did come in, they

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,740
seemed to do a really good job.

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,180
Like they did good job with appraisal and all of those other skills and

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,300
just kept kind of building them.

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,740
I don't know if they just kept building them because they were spending so

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,140
much time with each other, maybe.
