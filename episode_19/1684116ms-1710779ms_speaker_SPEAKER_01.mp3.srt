Yeah, I feel like a lot of the stories in Dwarf Fortress kind of come about a little bit like a

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:13,280
pearl being formed by sand. There's just one weird thing about this person, a bit like in real life,

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,640
that then sort of becomes their personality slash how they're shaping their environment

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,000
around themselves. And that results in a story and then having multiple of those together

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,560
then becomes an actual story.
