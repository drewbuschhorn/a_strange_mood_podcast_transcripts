00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
uh it kind of that makes me kind of think about um fire emblem and how you can

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:13,520
romance characters but there's always one who's sort of intended to be your romantic partner

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,440
and um like the one which one fates i think is the one that i played the most of

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,480
my i made my main character marry her butler just because i thought he was a fun character and um

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,760
but they didn't necessarily complement each other in fighting styles in the way that the

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,600
intended partner would and the story ends up being a little bit different but then it's also

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,400
on rails at the same time so even though you're allowed to play within the structure of the story

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,360
and you can get other npcs to fall in love and stuff like that too it's still the same events

9
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,440
are going to happen more or less
