1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Exactly. I thought that was a good place for Fiery City to end.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Yes.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,000
And also with the fact that we've killed that Forgotten Beast, you know, eventually we can maybe try to reclaim this fort.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,500
Yeah, good point.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,000
But I'm going to follow your advice and next round start on the mainland and do that.
