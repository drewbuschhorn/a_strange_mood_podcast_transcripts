00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
Oh yeah, setting everything else on fire and more dwarves.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,880
So I was just watching them die one by one in the squad menu.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,920
Even the squad leader was killed.

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:18,000
So I began to replace them with dwarves with any kind of relevant skills.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,740
And those new recruits became nothing more than literal kindling for the beast's fires.

6
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:31,500
It was actually kind of impressive to watch the storage bins just burn and burn and eventually

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,580
turn into charcoal and the workshops burned up.
