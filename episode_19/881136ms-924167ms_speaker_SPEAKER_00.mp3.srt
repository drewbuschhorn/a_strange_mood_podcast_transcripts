1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,240
Oh, I should sic the cat on it.

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:06,680
I would be devastated if that cat died, though, so I'll let it run.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:12,440
It's still qualified or counted as a city, even though we didn't get promoted from barony

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,760
to duchy or whatever.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:21,280
58 dwarves remain, and the traders arrived, and I was able to buy enough drinks to replace

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,840
all of the drinks that had been burned up, and some plump helmets and meat and stuff,

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,840
so we'll see what happens.

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,560
Yes, the baroness's husband, who is the main character of the story that I wrote and recorded

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,840
earlier today, is dead, presumably burnt to a crisp.

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,800
He's listed, I think, as missing, which all of the ones who were just incinerated are,

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,000
I think, listed as missing.
