00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
It's kind of like, again, it's a little bit like D&D in that way, where as a DM you want to tell,

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,720
you kind of have an idea of a story you want to tell. And you create these characters,

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:16,640
but frequently the players then are like, become super obsessed and curious about this one guy

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,640
that you kind of threw in there as a throwaway character of an idea you had while you were,

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,480
you know, drinking a soda. And they become obsessed and like, this must be a really

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,560
important person. Or they just fall in love with that.

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:28,800
Right.
