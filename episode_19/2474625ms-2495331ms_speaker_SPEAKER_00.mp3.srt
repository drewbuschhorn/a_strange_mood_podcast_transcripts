1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
I think also that could be why none of the characters actually love me is because I joked

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,600
that like Shadowheart kind of thinks I'm a loose cannon and I think that it might be

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:16,480
possible that I'm making kind of unpredictable choices for these individual characters' stories

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,920
and so they don't love me other than Will.

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,920
Will loves me.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,680
But we'll talk about that next week.
