Yeah, exactly. And I think that Dwarf Fortress in particular is really interesting for this

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:11,040
type of exercise because you can tell a grand epic story of this settlement, but you can also

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,880
tell these tiny little stories of dwarven day-to-day life. I had really, really wanted

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,280
to tell a story of a child dwarf who had lost her parents. Oh, she survived the demon attack

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:30,800
that both of her parents died to. And she was despairing and wandering, but she would still

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,120
go and play make-believe. But then ultimately, she didn't do anything. She would sleep,

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:44,800
she would play make-believe, she'd eat, and that was it. And so I ended up not really being able to

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,560
write a story about that because there's just nothing there. So sometimes there are dead ends

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,880
in that way too, in the same way that you start a fort with this idea that you're going to do this

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:01,040
huge project, but then you don't have the resources you need, or you keep getting attacked by zombies

11
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,520
or something like that, and it just defies you.
