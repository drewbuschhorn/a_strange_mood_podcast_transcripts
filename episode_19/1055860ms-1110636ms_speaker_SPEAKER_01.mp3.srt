00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,080
Yes. Yes, it was. But let me tell you, during our last update, we ended with another forgotten

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,320
beast wave coming into Fire City, which we fought off, but resulted in many, many injuries.

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:23,920
Those people were then taken to our hospital, where because the, through the, where through

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:33,760
the oversight of our mayor, no actual diagnostician was appointed in the hospital.

5
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,240
Oh dear.

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:42,080
And by an oversight, nothing was really done about the soap situation either, to the point that

7
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,000
everyone who was injured in that hospital had rotting infections.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,600
Oh no, that's so gross.

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,560
So the hospital just became kind of a place of miasma and rot.
