Yeah. Well, I mean, yeah, that's how it works with storytelling. You come up with two characters

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,160
and then figure out why would they fall in love. Absolutely. And what they would love

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,840
about each other. It's interesting to me to think about like that line between storytelling

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:22,000
and roleplaying because they're the same but also not. Would you say that roleplaying is

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,760
like a subset of storytelling?
