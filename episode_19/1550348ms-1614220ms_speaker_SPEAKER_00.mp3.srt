1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
Yeah and so sometimes that can be like we've talked about with like a project fort or a particular

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,440
location that you want to explore but sometimes you just find a dwarf who's interesting like the

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,960
one you had that zany yeah that's anyone back at the beginning yeah yeah and so you can kind of

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,600
follow them and and see who they interact with and what they do and if that becomes a story

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,840
and like I mentioned for the story at the end of the episode that I wrote I just was really like

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,920
taken with this idea of just a totally normal couple finding themselves just suddenly royalty

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,400
with solid gold floors and um and like the juxtaposition of that with the fact that they're

8
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:47,760
eating like long biscuits and this mediocre food and none of that stuff changes but here we're

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:55,520
royalty so uh it's more like a little vignette than a story but that that is kind of how those

10
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,880
things can get started and and thinking about that I um was thinking about like your power

11
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,680
couple how did you how did that come to speak to you?
