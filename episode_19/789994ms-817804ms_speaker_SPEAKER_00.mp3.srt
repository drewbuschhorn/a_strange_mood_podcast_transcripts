1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
everyone elected in the order of succession, so.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,120
I did notice that the new mayor has a lot of friends

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,920
and acquaintances and stuff in the fort,

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,440
so that was kind of interesting.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,400
I guess maybe they would have been better suited

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,720
to be mayor eventually anyway.

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,160
Eventually, the beast was struck down,

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,920
not by one of our ax lords or expert spearmen,

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,000
but by Stackgood Humorpict,

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,480
pet cat of English Wealdips.

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,960
Yes, the beast was killed by a cat.
