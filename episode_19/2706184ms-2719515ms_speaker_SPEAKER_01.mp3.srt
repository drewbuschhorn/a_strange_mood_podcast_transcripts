1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My other issue is how much of the interesting detail

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,140
that Dwarf Fortress generates

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,920
that then disappears off into the ether,

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,480
unavailable to the player to access, really.
