1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
The trauma still lurked deep in young Solon's eyes.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,260
The child would recover, but he and his sister would not remember their father as he had

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:07,260
once been.

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,140
"'Don't you see how marvelous this is?'

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:14,220
Ral asked, interpreting his maudlin reverie with a sweeping gesture around their new quarters.

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,220
She had a point.

7
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,620
The engraved floor was all made of silver, the goblin-capped bed of the highest quality.

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,860
Even their storage chests were masterpieces, carved of jet and marble.

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,740
A jet armor stand stood in one quarter, though neither of them served on a squadron.

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,540
And as they spoke, Ral angrily hung a spider-silk dress in a golden cabinet.
