1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,060
But looking ahead, I probably will start a new fort.

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:10,460
The new forgotten beast, although it sounded pretty cool and I was excited to go and look

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,460
at it.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,920
It is the forgotten beast Ushrir, a gigantic three-eyed antlion larva.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,060
It has two long spiral horns and it undulates rhythmically.

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:27,840
Its pearl exoskeleton is sleek and smooth and it has a poisonous bite.

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,560
So I was excited to see what it was going to do and I went and looked at it.

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,540
This part looks like it's biter, so that's not very interesting.

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,680
And it's just hanging out in the second cavern level, not even near where our animals are.

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,880
So I don't know if it's going to do anything.
