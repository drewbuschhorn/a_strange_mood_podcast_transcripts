1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Truly, it is a blessing for our family.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,560
I love the dining room especially.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,040
The dining room was rather ironic, though.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,360
Fully engraved gold floors and a jet table did not improve the quality of giant cave-swallow

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,480
lung biscuits and the same old dwarven wine, but Adil saw now that Ral did not want to

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,480
hear that.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,280
There had been nothing wrong with their old quarters.

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,100
They were spacious, fully engraved, good honest mudstone floors and walls.

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,800
But Adil had been unsatisfied.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,540
Ral was right about that.

11
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,940
They had their children and both were healthy and very happy.

12
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,620
Ral was certainly happy, mining and hauling and socializing in the tavern.
