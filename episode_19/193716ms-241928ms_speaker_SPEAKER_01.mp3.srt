1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
the 8th annual tournament.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:02,960
Tournament.

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,440
Hope it's the 8th, I didn't actually write it down this time.

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,640
But we're just going to run with 8th.

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,140
Sure.

6
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,440
So, over at Bay12Games, you can read the entire fight yourself,

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,480
but the tournament wound up with Logum Branch Syrup, the Wolverine Man,

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,680
versus Knifing Around, the Hori Marmot Woman,

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,920
which I remember we talked about both of them previously.

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,560
Yeah.

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,840
Katana Blows from Logum gave him an early lead,

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,480
and Knifing Around was never able to recover,

13
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,920
losing legs, feet, arms, and hands every time she tried to attack Logum.

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,840
Eventually, after one last lunge cost her what remained of her left arm,

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,560
Knifing Around's blood-streaked body slammed to the ground and failed to rise again.

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,000
Congratulations to Logum Branch Syrup, champion of the 8th tournament.
