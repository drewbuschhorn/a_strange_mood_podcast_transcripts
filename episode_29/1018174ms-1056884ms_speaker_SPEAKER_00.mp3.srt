00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So many dwarves died, like, upwards of 10, I think,

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,120
because of becoming were-raccoons

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,320
and then getting murdered by other dwarves,

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,560
who then became were-raccoons and got murdered,

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,360
and you see how this goes.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,760
And one of them, in fact, was a child,

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,920
and I was like trying to isolate,

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,959
and she was playing make-believe in a tomb,

9
00:00:23,959 --> 00:00:25,840
like you do if you're a dwarven child,

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,400
and I just locked her in there.

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,799
But I felt real bad.

12
00:00:29,799 --> 00:00:33,080
She was still alive when I retired the fort.

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,360
I'm using air quotes there

14
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,599
because that was just a nope, nope, nope situation,

15
00:00:37,599 --> 00:00:38,680
and I abandoned it.
