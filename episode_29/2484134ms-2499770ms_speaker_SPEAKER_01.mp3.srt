00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
I listened to In Search Of, which is going back and reviewing episodes of In Search Of,

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,080
a 70s TV show with Leonard Nimoy, talking about the various issues in each episode,

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,440
and I'm like, I'm mostly just listening to this because I like the energy of the hosts.
