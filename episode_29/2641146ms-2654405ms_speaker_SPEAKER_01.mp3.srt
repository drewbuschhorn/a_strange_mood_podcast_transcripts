00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
I once got in trouble in an English class because they made us do a poem using assonance

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:11,440
and I made a joke at the end that because I did an imperfect rhyme at the end with assonance

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,200
I said it was half assonance.
