1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
It's like I studied poetry.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,840
We did not study a qualitative trochaic tetrameter.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,640
Oh, you got it.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,680
You did it wrong.

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,280
You messed it up.

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,840
All right, you got to say it right now.

7
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,080
We're too happy about that.

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,000
Qualitative trochaic tetrameter.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,920
You can't hesitate.

10
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,320
It's like pouring a liquid.

11
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,840
If you hesitate, it's just going to dribble everywhere.

12
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,760
You have to be bold.
