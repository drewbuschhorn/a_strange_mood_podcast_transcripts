But also, they've been trying to add in multi-threading,

00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,260
and that's just going to cause crashes.

00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,680
From a programmer point of view, it's

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,380
hard to get that right, especially when you didn't

5
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,760
build from the ground up with it.

6
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,460
So that's just life.

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,180
Since the update two days ago, I think,

8
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,379
as of when we're recording this.
