1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Yes, Nick apostrophe-

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
A mod belonging to Nick.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Yes.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay.

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,560
Because Nick wrote in to them suggesting that someone, possibly he, but also whoever, write

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,680
a mod to make succession forts easier to do.

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,680
Oh, yeah.

8
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,680
And have it be kind of an automated process where people could, you know, check it out,

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,040
do it for a year, and then when their year is up, it uploads it back to the server.

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,340
Ah, very cool.

11
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,500
And then the next person can download and do theirs and put some sort of like timer

12
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,040
on it so that, you know, if you don't do it, if you don't upload it within a year or two

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,040
weeks-

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,040
They post to the next one.

15
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,040
Yeah.

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,040
And I thought that that was actually pretty cool.

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,720
The roundtable guys seemed to think it was pretty cool too.

18
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,360
So hope someone writes that.

19
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,080
Yeah, someone get on that.

20
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,080
Yeah.

21
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,480
If I were a millionaire, I might sit down and just write that tonight.

22
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,480
But yeah.

23
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,480
Yeah.

24
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,480
Yeah.

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,480
Yeah.

26
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,480
Yeah.

27
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,480
Yeah.

28
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,480
Yeah.

29
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,480
Yeah.
