1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
I think that I've chosen my settlements based on, like, I want to be in a good location

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:13,240
or in this case I'm on, you know, the island continent that is like Australia.

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,840
And I had briefly, like, looked around for a tropical location because I wanted to see

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,520
the different flora and fauna, but then I was having a really hard time finding a satisfactory

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:27,000
location which is how I ended up where I am on the, I think it's the Savage Continent

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,960
or something like that of my world.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:38,360
But I know that other people start with, like, wanting to start a mega project or run, like,

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:57,720
a team-based project so, yeah, medium travel's the best route for me.
