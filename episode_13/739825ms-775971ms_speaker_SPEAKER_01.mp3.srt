1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
that you want. Exactly because you know you can do that you can do that filter by sand and clay

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,120
all the different metal ores that sort of thing so okay I think that's kind of how I figured that

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:18,960
out but as to the inspiration for what you know kind of material I think a lot of these themed

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:26,560
forts are frequently around materials of some sort like yeah I'm going to make an all platinum fort

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:36,400
right or an all copper fort yeah or an all glass fort or a water fort or a magma fort yeah
