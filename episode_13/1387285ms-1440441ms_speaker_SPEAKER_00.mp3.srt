00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
And unfortunately, I have upgraded his quarters because I thought I was upgrading the Baroness's

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:13,600
quarters. And he's very happy. But even though that was my goof, I'm now like, well,

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,320
there's drama between them. And there's political corruption. Because also his friend,

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,480
Vabak Oilcrafts, just became the sacred shell of the denomination of dissenses. And that,

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:32,240
that is a temple agreement that I actually managed to fulfill, because I really hurriedly went in

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:38,800
and gave them gold altars and all this stuff. And they're very pleased with their new temple,

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,800
because he's friends with the mayor. And so the mayor got it done. Whereas,

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,760
Aerith belongs to the denomination of hardiness. And that's one of the pacts that I failed.

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,200
And her temple is crummy. So.
