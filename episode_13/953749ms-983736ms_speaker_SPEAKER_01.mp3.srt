A lot of people have talked about zoo forts where they, you know, capture and tie down

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,720
different animals and stuff. I think an aquarium fort would be kind of fun because you could make

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,360
glass bins and fill...is it glass bins? Glass traps? I'm not entirely sure, but you can make

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,720
some sort of glass container, fill it with water, and then put aquatic creatures in there.

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,960
We have a lot of sea otters that have shown up, so I'll see if maybe I can capture some of them

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,080
and hit them.
