00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
Yeah, he's doing an adventure mode project. And which version is that in? 47 something?

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,040
I was coming up 47. 4705 I think.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:16,880
Yeah, and he got volunteers from within our Discord, including us, and had us pick

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,760
characters kind of with stats. And so I'm an elf with high agility. And he has been updating us on

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,760
the adventures of our little characters and the queen of the fences of incinerating,

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,560
one of the last dwarven civilizations, has sent us on an adventure, which has started.

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:52,880
And I was quite tickled because I chose to be an elf. Gasp. And I get a war tiger.
