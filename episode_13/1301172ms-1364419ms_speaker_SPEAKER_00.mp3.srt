00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
Yeah, right. I mean I could make it like a really really nice room and put in therapy cats or dogs

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,640
or whatever. It would be convenient if she liked one of the animals that we have.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:17,600
But uh so we still have our Baroness Eryth Rekrok who is the mother of five and survived the initial

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:24,400
demon attack and everything. She is not very happy despite being made Baroness. I think part of it is

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:31,120
that she doesn't really have like a specialty in terms of her labor. So she's not really being

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:37,040
satisfied with anything that she's doing chore-wise or making-wise. And I think she wants

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,480
military training but I'm not going to assign one of my nobles to a squad.

8
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,320
She also needs her rooms upgraded and I started working on that today and hopefully that'll

9
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:55,760
cheer her up. So I gave her some silver furniture like her weapon rack and armor stand are made of

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,960
silver and a nice dining room that's all like color coordinated and some quartzite furniture

11
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:19,120
in there, marble flooring.
