00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
I might be missing some stuff. So we'll revisit that and I'm excited because maybe I can find out more.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:12,160
But I went through and pulled out some of my deities. A couple of them just because they have fun names.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,880
So we have Gembish Glitter Sculpture, who is the deity of sun, nature, and water.

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,080
Doesn't have a cult at our temple, but has 45 followers.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,580
Nice.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:29,520
We have, let's see, Nikot Nighted Quest, which is wind and sky.

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,480
It's very pleasant.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:30,980
What?
