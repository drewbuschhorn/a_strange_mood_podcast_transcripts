00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,640
I feel like once I was in Legends mode, DFHack had like export to XML.

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,280
No that's part of it now.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,760
That's part of Legends mode now?

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,760
Yeah, that's part of it.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,760
Even without DFHack?

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,760
Oh, fair enough.

7
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:31,080
Yeah, it's that simple.
