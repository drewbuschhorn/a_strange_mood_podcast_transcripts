1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
Yeah, and now everything is penguins.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,360
Ah, and then we've also had some attacks that have not been that bad.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,240
We had two in a row, ogre attacks, and we killed them both in minutes.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,440
And I think that the way that I set the fort up has really helped with that,

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,720
because we have one entrance that's just one tile wide, and it has a door, and I just lock it.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,920
And then the other one, we have a stone stockpile right by it,

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,360
and I just build a wall to close it up as soon as I get the notification that something bad's

8
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,800
happening. Fair enough.

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,160
Yeah, and then I've walled us pretty well into the caverns, and we've had serpent people

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:58,000
attacking, and they are, their sprite is fun. They're like a virulent neon gross looking green.
