00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
I just, I've found kind of that with my forts I'll have an idea of like what I want to do.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,080
Like I'm going to do scholarship or I want to have water nearby so that I can make a

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,040
waterfall for over the entrance for the winter.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,600
And then as in the case of Bellblade, I discovered that while I had water nearby, it completely

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,840
goes away in the winter.

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,040
So I wasn't able to do that with just what I had on hand.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:31,080
I would have had to work harder.
