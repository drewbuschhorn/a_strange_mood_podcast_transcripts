1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
Yeah, I suppose. Their dwarf deity is the Hero of Cradling, and there are 96 followers at our fort.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,440
Jeez.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,960
Yeah. The Denomination of Hardiness follows Anoth Gaitnurish as the Symmetric Flag,

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:22,800
who is a human deity and has, I actually don't know how many followers, worshipers they have

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,760
in our fort, but they only have 10 in the cult, because those numbers are not necessarily the

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,400
same as what we discovered this afternoon. So I guess it's like they're Methodists and Lutherans

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:41,600
and those are different. Anyway, so that's what's happening with the nobility, and I'm going to try

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,680
to work to cheer those two up a little bit. I really would like to provide a not super unhappy

9
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,520
ending for that child, but we'll see. I had to exile a couple of our other dwarves that we'd

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,800
been following because they were depressed and there was no turning back, and I had replacements

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:06,640
by that point. Sorry, guys. Updating from last week, the animal training continues. You remember

12
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,080
we had some elk birds and I watched the elk bird fail her training and be led to the pasture

13
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,160
repeatedly, and she was just terrified. That's still kind of continuing. Some of them are really

14
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:24,080
holding on to their training great, and others still wander off and have to be recaught in traps

15
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:31,040
and refreshed in their training. The Drunians were kind of okay trained, but we were having

16
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:38,720
food problems and I slaughtered them all. Yeah, it's rough. But on the bright side, the bug bats

17
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:47,040
have taken swimmingly, flyingly to training, and now we have so many pet bug bats. But I looked at

18
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:54,080
them and they all belong to one dude. One man. Yes, one man, farmer Sibrek Trade Breaches,

19
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:00,640
has adopted four bug bats so far. I didn't check when I closed out my fort today to see if he had

20
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,800
adopted any more because when I initially looked at them, he had three and two of them were mated

21
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,280
to each other and had recently had some pups, and then one of them was another adult, and then he

22
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:18,240
adopted one of the pups. And I was like, who is this weirdo who is so into bug bats? And I looked

23
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:43,440
up his preferences, and he does indeed like bug bats for their freakish insect heads.
