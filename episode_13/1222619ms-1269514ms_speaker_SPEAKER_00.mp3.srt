1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,700
Yes, yeah, and was just down there laying helplessly until I finally made a hospital and someone took her there to rest

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:13,060
She is still extremely depressed and I keep getting that she's stumbling around

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,020
obliviously

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,320
Notification, but then I'll go and follow her and she'll just like go play pretend outside for a while

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,160
And she hasn't had the death by dehydration or starvation that you often see with those dwarves

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,260
She hasn't had a tantrum so we haven't had to execute her

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:36,540
She's just miserable and hanging around and I'm not really sure what to do about that. You know, I'm not really sure about the cat therapy room

8
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,740
I guess I could find other things that she likes and see if I could make her a statue or something that would cheer her up

9
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,780
I don't think it would like she just I guess needs to build up some happy memories.
