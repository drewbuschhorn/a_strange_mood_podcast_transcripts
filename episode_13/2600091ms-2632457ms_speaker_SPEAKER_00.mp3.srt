1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
I think the odds of me seeing some of these dwarves

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,200
is quite, quite slim.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,240
In looking at some of the unknown connections,

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,640
I think it was even maybe they were just called connections,

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,040
which leads me to believe maybe I don't have my full life

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,720
sport, I learned that dwarves can get divorced.

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,520
Interesting.

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,520
I didn't realize that.

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,640
Yeah, so I was following one dwarf who

10
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,760
had numerous spouse listings.

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,840
And she had one dead husband and had divorced another

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,160
and has recently remarried.

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,920
So she might be an interesting lady.

14
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,320
Exactly.

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,860
Wow.
