00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
need to have you show me how to see like a list of deities or whatever because I went

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,720
back into my game and went and found the deities that are worshipped at my temple and then

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,120
I went over and looked them up.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,840
I'm also, I didn't realize the thing that there's a different export from DFHack so

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:35,840
now I'm like did I?
