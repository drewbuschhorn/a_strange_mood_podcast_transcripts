1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,240
But 12 people is kind of nice because it does give me the opportunity to really get to know the individual dwarves.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:08,740
Yeah.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,580
And so I did a little hunting around to see what drama was going on,

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:17,280
and in the process I realized that the dwarf who had been killed by the Sparrow Women

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,300
was in fact not an unimportant, easily disposed of dwarf,

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,800
but instead was Cadol Pully Worship,

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,100
the lover of Zuglar Dimple Lashes, our expedition leader.
