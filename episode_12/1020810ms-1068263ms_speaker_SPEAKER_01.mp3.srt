00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
Okay, okay, you gotta let me talk about my caged elk birds.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,640
So like I said, I had seven.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,000
That was actually, I think, six female and one male,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,040
but you know, good enough.

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,760
Although now we're down to five

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,580
because I did run out of food.

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,880
Sorry, half-trained elk birds, but you got it.

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,300
And one of them, some of its bones

9
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,800
got turned into an artifact.

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,640
Ooh.

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,720
Yeah.

12
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,980
So they were in their cages.

13
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,360
I put them in, I made like a little animal training room.

14
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,160
And the trainer went presumably into there

15
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,580
and fed them little bits of food

16
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,440
and turned them into trained elk birds.

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,540
So at that point, I assigned the male

18
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,660
and one of the females to a pasture,

19
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:48,660
hoping to get new baby elk birds.
