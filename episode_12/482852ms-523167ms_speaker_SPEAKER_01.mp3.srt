1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
Maybe? It's very possible. He has some friends. Not a lot.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,800
But the noteworthy thing there is that the angry child, Rith, is one of his friends.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,800
I thought that was kind of sweet.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,000
Another interesting side note when I was looking into him.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I apparently at some point in the game had had a guild hall request.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,200
And I thought I fulfilled it by just making the guild hall.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,200
I think it needed to be a certain value.

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:36,200
Because he, Onel the mayor, has the memory of feeling dismayed failing to meet a guild hall pact.

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,200
Or requirement. Yeah.

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,200
Guild hall pact.

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:57,200
So, yeah.
