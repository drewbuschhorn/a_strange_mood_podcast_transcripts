1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
They talked about it some in an interview

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,440
with the Dwarf Fortress team, so Zac and Tarn,

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,080
and the Caves of Qud team,

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,160
part of the PC Gamer Chat Log podcast,

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,320
we'll include that in the show notes,

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,440
where they talked about the plans for Adventure Mode,

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,080
how chat GPT, GPT-4 stuff is influencing

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,920
kind of the creation of more content

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,240
within Dwarf Fortress, Cave of Qud.

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,200
And just kind of about the respective games

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,440
and their philosophies, because Caves of Qud

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,440
is kind of like an Adventure Mode,

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,040
is like what Dwarf Fortress Adventure Mode is,

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,760
except it has a built-in story

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,180
that you're not pushed through,

16
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,080
but being gently encouraged to follow.

17
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,360
Interesting.

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,280
And Caves of Qud, I've played on stream a time or two,

19
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,560
and it's fun.

20
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,400
Cool.

21
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,360
So I think that's everything I had.
