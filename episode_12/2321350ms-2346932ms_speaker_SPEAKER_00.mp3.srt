00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The professions being a grouping for the skills.

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The skills are kind of, the skills act a little bit like Elder Scrolls for those of you who've played that,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
which is a use it or lose it skill system, where the more you use a given skill, the more XP you gain in it,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and the less you use it, or the more that you don't use it over time, it begins to degrade.
