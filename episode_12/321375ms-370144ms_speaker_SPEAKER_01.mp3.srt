00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Yeah, she's presumably had training before. I don't know that I remember her. I wish I could say that I did.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
But, I'm glad she's doing so well. I feel like mother of five- single mom, five children, has killed numerous monsters.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm proud of you, Limole.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And then finally we have Rith Guildthunders. This is the child who was left to die after Heroic Drain the demon attacked.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Both her parents are dead and she was hospitalized for a very long time with crushed ribs.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
She's out now. She is playing and has toys and is starting to build up some good memories.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Like, she saw a performance that she liked and she has a nice bedroom, but then she got haunted by a ghost.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Well, that never helps.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:56,000
No, so she's still pretty unhappy.
