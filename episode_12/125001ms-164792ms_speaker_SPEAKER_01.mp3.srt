00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Well, I have a lot of news from Bellblade, actually.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:10,240
But first, I thought we might do a little check-in on our dwarves from last week that you may remember

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,560
survived the demon attack and then the blind cave ogre attack.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,480
I have a couple of those in traps, too.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,160
Hmm, not sure what to do about this.

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:25,520
So let's check in on those dwarves that I kind of established as our cast of characters last week.

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:32,640
We have Azum Glaze Inches, the former militia commander who was in a dreadful mood.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,800
Injured, all of that stuff.

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:52,880
Well, she has slipped into a depression.
