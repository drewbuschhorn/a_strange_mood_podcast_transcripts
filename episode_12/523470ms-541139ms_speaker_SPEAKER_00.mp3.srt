00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,880
and I think other people we know have as well.

00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,800
Challenges with making sure that that count of the value

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,320
of the area you've designated as a guild hall

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,920

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,360
Hopefully that gets fixed sometime soon.
