1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
The point of Dwarf Fortress is the stories.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,840
And I feel like Copper Streams had a good story.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,340
It really did.

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,500
And that was an epic ending.

5
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,360
It was.

6
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,120
I thought it was very thematically nice

7
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,480
that we had the amber beast, you know,

8
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,960
amber is kind of copper colored.

9
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,720
And then the copper crypts is one of the squads.

10
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,320
Although the furnaces of virginity

11
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,880
was also just hilarious at the time.

12
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,200
Yeah, that was really funny.

13
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,400
And yeah, so I was pretty happy with that.

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,560
Yeah.

15
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,320
And then comes the part that is sort of like when

16
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,920
you have to eat a challenging meal

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,120
and then have an interesting dessert.

18
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,320
No, that's not quite right.

19
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,760
But you know what I'm saying.
