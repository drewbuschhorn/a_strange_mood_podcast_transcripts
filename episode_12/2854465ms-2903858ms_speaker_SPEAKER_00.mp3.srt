00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,760
I created a transcription system for us to load up past episodes and create transcriptions out of

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,680
that using OpenAI and all that sort of thing. We will be including links to those in each of our

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,960
episodes going forward, and the back catalog has been updated with links to it. Those are in two

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:28,640
parts. One, the direct link is to kind of a fixed up version where some of it has been cleaned up by

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,600
the AI system. It sometimes also gets a little creative and might have the occasional phrase

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,720
that wasn't actually in the podcast, but overall I think it flows pretty well. Take a look, let me

7
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,600
know what you think. Also, it's open source, so if you guys want that, you can grab it for any

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:01:02,240
of your podcasts and use it to parse those out relatively cheaply.
