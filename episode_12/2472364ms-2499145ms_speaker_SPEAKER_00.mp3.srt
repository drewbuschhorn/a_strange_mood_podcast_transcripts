00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
And for those with a legendary skill in something that doesn't result in a craft output,

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,200
their performance becomes shockingly fast. Someone with a legendary in shearing, for example,

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,840
will shear an animal in one tick as opposed to five or ten ticks for even someone who isn't

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,000
legendary. Like one level below legendary, they're still taking ten ticks to do it,

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,440
where a legendary will do it in one step.
