1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
Not even a little bit, but it was really funny for me.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,680
So eventually I put her in a cage again

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,360
and replaced her with a more bittable female.

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,960
Oh no, it's terrible sounding.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,960
So according to the wiki,

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,880
elk birds can be really hard to breed.

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,320
So I don't have really high hopes

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,160
for having a permanent army of elk birds,

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,360
but fingers crossed.

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,480
And I might get some drunions and bug bats

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,640
trained for pets just for fun.

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,560
But in order to really get them to be pets,

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,660
you have to take them through nine levels of training

14
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,600
from wild to domesticated.

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,720
The value of the pet is somewhere assigned to them

16
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,240
that I found on the wiki.

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,560
That determines how much time it takes to train them.

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,560
So elk birds, for example, are very low value pets

19
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,460
and are trained quickly

20
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,420
versus something I'm assuming like a unicorn

21
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,760
is a high value pet and would take a lot longer

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,600
and more skill.

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,620
Makes sense.

24
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,080
Wild animals that you've caged and started training

25
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,480
require ongoing training to hold on to their knowledge.

26
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,040
So if you stop training them,

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,500
they'll just revert to at least semi-wild.

28
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,200
But then if they have babies,

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,160
those babies will be domesticated.

30
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:28,160
Hooray.
