1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And yeah, we had to deal with that ghost, another ghost, and then a third ghost that appeared over the course of the next...

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So many ghosts.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,500
Yeah. But we built slabs for them all, got that all engraved for each of them, put them down, exercised them, or whatever we want to call that.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,000
Right.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And things, again, started to settle down.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,500
Good.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,500
When we had our first migrant wave.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,000
Oh.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Where it announced that some migrants had decided to brave this place, knowing it may be their tomb.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,500
Right.
