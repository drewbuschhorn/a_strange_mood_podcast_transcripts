00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,080
Exactly. Any given skill starts at zero and increases up to 18,000 XP, with each level

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:15,520
increasing by 100. From zero to the first level is 100, second is 200, and so on. The decay of

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:21,600
that skill decays according to a pretty complicated clock within Dwarf Fortress. You know, there are

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:51,600
three intersecting systems, and da da da da da.
