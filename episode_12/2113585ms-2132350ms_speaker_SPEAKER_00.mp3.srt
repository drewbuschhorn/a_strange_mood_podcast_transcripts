Yeah, but now that I'm having to settle a new fortress,

00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,160
I've really been putting my mind to professions

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,280
and how all of that works together in Dwarf Fortress.

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,400
So I thought I'd talk a little bit about that.

00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,440
The topic was suggested by one of our listeners

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,400
over in our Discord.

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:41,400
You should really join the Discord if you haven't already.
