00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
Yeah, it would be really nice to just have those in the equivalent of a post-it on my

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,720
screen.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,720
Yeah.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,960
And I might have to start doing it as post-its on a screen because I didn't realize that

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,480
I hadn't gotten that to be valuable enough for them.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:31,000
So sorry, Guild.
