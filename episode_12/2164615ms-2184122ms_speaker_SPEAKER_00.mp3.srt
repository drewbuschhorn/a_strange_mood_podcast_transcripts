00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
It's important to distinguish between professions and labors,

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,120
because when you say a dwarf's profession,

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,760
I think most humans initially think

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,440
they're labor, i.e. what task are they assigned to do.

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,560
But instead, profession is a representation

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,840
of your dwarf's best skill in order

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:28,480
to help you decide what they should be working on.
