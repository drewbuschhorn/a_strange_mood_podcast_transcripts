00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
Yes, so that was okay, and we haven't seen any forgotten beasts yet.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:11,060
I'm glad about that because, especially because we're still working on our defenses. In the caverns,

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,400
my trap system has worked really, really well, and

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,800
we have the aforementioned plump helmet men and

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,780
blind cave ogres, some bug bats, and six druunians, which are a large

6
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:31,320
quadruped with a mane circling its man-like face and hands at the end of its forelimbs.

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,940
It lives underground and is fond of raiding the supplies of cavern outposts.

8
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,840
I've never encountered them, but now I have six of them in cages.

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,000
We also have captured seven elk birds, and

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I have started training them.
