00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Yeah, and eventually I'm going to use it to create summaries and stuff for us about past episodes,

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,920
make sure we don't cover the same ground, but also I think be able to make a little

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,280
wiki of topics we've covered, all that sort of thing.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:13,760
Yeah.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,600
So let's see.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,120

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,800
You should listen to the roundtable about that.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,880
I'm trying to think of any I wanted to mention at the moment, but I think mostly just to check them out.
