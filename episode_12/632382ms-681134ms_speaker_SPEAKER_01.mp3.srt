1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
It really is, I was quite surprised.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,980
So I could not figure out why we didn't have any food

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,960
because we were farming and we were farming,

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,320
like I assumed, you know, plump helmets are all.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,640
But then I realized that I had also turned off

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,420
plant gathering when I was trying to turn the fort around

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,640
so that people could like rest and recover and feel happy

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,220
and not be out gathering plants.

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,920
So I realized that, turned it on,

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,720
it immediately started helping.

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,840
But then as Dwarf Fortress is,

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,840
a giant Kia stole a step ladder.

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,540
No, correction, a giant Kia stole the step ladder.

14
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,840
There's only one in the fort.

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,600
There was only one in the fort,

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:01:10,600
out from under the dwarves gathering in a tree.
