00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
So I hadn't realized that it just meant that's their best skill, right?

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,280
So I have Bim who's an animal trainer and another guy who's an animal trainer, and Bim's

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,240
animals were always better trained than the other guys, even though they're both animal

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,240
trainers.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:39,320
So I'm assuming Bim is just good at it.
