1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
Yeah. And then we have Aerith Leded, our bookkeeper, who was quite happy despite everything that went wrong.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,480
She's still pretty happy. She's been teaching mining, which is interesting because I didn't really...

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,520
She's a bookkeeper, but she's apparently a very good miner and has been doing some demonstrations

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,400
and helped someone to bed after another attack and felt very proud of herself for that.

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,200
And the further update for her is that her religious sect, the Denomination of Hardiness,

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,160
which I have seen before in my world, just requested a temple. And I think she will be

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,040
very happy about that. So she's one of my ecstatic dwarves and will continue to be happy.

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,520
Excellent.

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:50,320
Yes.
