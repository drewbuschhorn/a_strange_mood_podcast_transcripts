Yeah, so certain trapped animals, trapped wild animals can be trained in the STEAM version.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,600
Once you have them caged in your cage trap under others, you can assign them to a trainer. So

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,880
that's the others tab with like your population and your pets and livestock and it's that tab.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,120
Wild animals are trained in their cages, so you don't let them out, which is good because if they

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:29,440
don't go into a pasture, I am unclear on how to let animals out of cages. The training zone that

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:37,520
you can designate seems to be for domesticated animals like dogs. So animals that have a

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:52,880
permanent baseline of training will go and can be trained in that zone.
