1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
No, because then finally the forgotten beast, uh, blah blah blah has come.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,360
A huge eyeless salamander. It has a broad horn and gaunt appearance.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,680
Its pale skin is wrinkled. Beware its webs.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,680
Again, we're back to the webs.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,000
So that one burst up from the bottom of the mines, went through and basically rampaged,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,960
killing the squads that I had assigned to try to hold back any future forgotten beasts.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,960
And, uh, so that took out, I think, probably 15 out of the remaining 60 dwarves.

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,400
Then another 25 as it came up the, uh,

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,520
and at that point it got to the hospital where everyone recovering from the previous, uh,

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,960
forgotten beast fights were currently still recouping.

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,920
That then meant that it basically rampaged through that,

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,680
killing everyone. And that was the end of the fortress.

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,680
Thank you all so much for watching!
