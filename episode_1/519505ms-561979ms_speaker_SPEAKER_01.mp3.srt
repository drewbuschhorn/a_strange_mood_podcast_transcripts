1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Yeah, but that one that one actually did pretty okay

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,280
That was where I started trying to actually do a halfway real fort

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
with this new steam version and

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:19,560
Some interesting things that happened over the course of that one were a jabber attack whose name was soul feed

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,280
Jabber is sort of like a boogeyman that comes out of the depths as you dig down

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:31,280
into the into the earth. Yeah, and made a let's see. What did we get here?

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:38,320
We got the dwarven dwarven loot of the tight bolts and a toy hammer called the divine cudgel

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,680
And a copper axe called the sound of strangling. I love that
