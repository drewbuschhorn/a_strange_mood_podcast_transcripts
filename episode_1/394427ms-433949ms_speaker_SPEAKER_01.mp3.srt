This fort did not last super long because I was trying to get the hang of the new interface,

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,280
which is different than obviously the ASCII version.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:16,640
And it was actually abandoned after the discovery of a murdered child on the altar of its main temple.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,000
That's grim.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,040
Yeah. Blame was initially placed on the ghost of a drowned child whose ghost rose after being unburied too long,

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:32,320
because if someone is unburied in Dwarf Fortress after they die, then they stand a decent chance of coming back as a ghost

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:39,120
and haunting your fort slash people who were important to them in life if there is anyone left like that.

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:49,120
Yeah.
