So that fort was going along pretty okay. There were no problems with it, but I decided to leave that one behind and start moving into more interesting areas because

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:22,000
throughout Dwarf Fortress, when you choose where to settle, each area kind of has a sort of what we would think of as a world biome, and then also a sort of malign or benign influences on it.

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And so I moved from what was basically a very middle-of-the-road location to a slightly more exciting location on the coast for my third fort, which is Swordbegins,

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:51,000
which I decided to make as a green glass fort, meaning I would take sand and create glass blocks and then use those glass blocks to build turrets and living areas that, in this case, I made a path out into the ocean.

I'll see you in the next video.
