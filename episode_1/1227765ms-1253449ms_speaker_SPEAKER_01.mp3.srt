No, it seems like the exoskeletons are frequently just registered the same way as bone, but

Dwarf Fortress is ridiculously modeled in how it deals with bodies.

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,360

00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:22,520
Basically, you can have teeth go flying out of a dwarf's skull when they're punched, and

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:38,520
just all sorts of weirdly detailed bits.
