1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
Yeah, and to build up like that.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,400
And the dwarves are actually very happy when you do that sort of thing, because

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,940
windows, even if the windows don't look out on anything inside the earth, windows

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:11,880
make them happy.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,360
Right.

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,280
They like looking out of the windows, even if there's nothing on the other side.

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,060
And in this case, they would be, well, they wound up being pretty happy because

8
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,800
the windows would look out on the ocean and they would see various types of fish

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,160
and other things swim by.

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:27,840
That's so cute.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That would delight them.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah.
