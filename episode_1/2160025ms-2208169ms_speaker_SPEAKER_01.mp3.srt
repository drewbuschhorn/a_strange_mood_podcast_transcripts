1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
Yeah, I mean, that's exactly right.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,520
To go back to the RimWorld example,

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,800
RimWorld does have a thing they call the producer AI,

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,440
which within it basically will decide that like,

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,320
okay, nothing much has happened,

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,200
you've got everything ticking along fine.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,220
So in RimWorld, the producer AI will decide,

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,400
okay, you're going to have an invasion now

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,720
or something like that.

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,000
And Dwarf Fortress doesn't do that.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,680
Dwarf Fortress is pretty,

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,600
has a high level of fidelity with its simulation.

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,800
Like it all just,

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,940
there are rules that they've set up at the beginning

15
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,840
and it just keeps ticking along,

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,680
applying those rules rather than kind of doing things ad hoc.

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,600
The only thing,

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,600
the only ad hoc thing in Dwarf Fortress is you.
