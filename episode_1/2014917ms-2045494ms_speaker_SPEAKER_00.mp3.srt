reminds me, not actually of The Sims, because in gameplay it doesn't remind me of The Sims,

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,280
but in the way that people create their own fun. And in The Sims, they create their own kind of

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,440
challenges. And like, here's a legacy challenge, and you play the same family for as long as

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,360
possible. Or you start with no money or things like that. And in this game, you also have to

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:27,360
choose what kind of story you want to be telling. And it does seem to lend itself to storytelling in

00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,400
that way, and not being told a story.
