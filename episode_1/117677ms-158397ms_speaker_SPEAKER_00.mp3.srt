00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Right. Yeah, I tried the ASCII version, like I said, and then I just I couldn't see what was

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,880
happening even a little bit. I was very confused by it. So we at that point knew that the Steam

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,040
version was forthcoming, and it seemed like it was at question mark, question mark, question

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,080

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,760
podcast, you know, and might be playing. And I'm really enjoying the Steam version. I like the

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,360
music. I like the graphics. It's been really enjoyable, especially I've played a lot of

00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,760
city builders and other simulation type games. And I think every single one that I do,

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:53,520
you were asking me about it and kind of gauging it on how dwarf fortressy it is.
