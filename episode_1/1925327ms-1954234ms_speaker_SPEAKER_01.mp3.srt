00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Yeah, so this is something, you know, we've talked about on walks and that sort of thing.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,680
That people call Dwarf Fortress a complicated game, but I'm not entirely sure that game

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:19,600
is the right word for it, because games usually imply some sort of end state, some sort of

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,840
there's winning and losing in a game.

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,560
And there's not really winning and losing in Dwarf Fortress.

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,120
Obviously if everyone in your fortress is killed, that's probably a loss.
