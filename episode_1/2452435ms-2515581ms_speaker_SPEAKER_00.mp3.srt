00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,500
Right. And the fact that, you know, sometimes there is concrete advice that can be given to answers or to questions like,

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:15,300
how do I deal with all these crundles? That was one that a problem that I had. And I asked you, how do I deal with all these crundles?

00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:23,000
So there are multiple. Just our animals are going crazy over here. It's like a zoo.

8
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:18,500
But we always play some of the new ones and we'll talk about those and give our recommendations.
