1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
But the nice thing about that level of detail, I think,

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,280
is that you can kind of choose

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,760
where you want to interact with it.

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,040
You can only be concerned about your fort.

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,580
You can be concerned about where your fort fits

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,240
in the larger fantasy world

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,400
that the game is procedurally creating as time goes on.

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,100
Or you can be concerned about individual dwarves

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,640
and their individual happiness, moods,

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,200
traits, characteristics.

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,160
I mean, you've dug into the different characteristics

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,320
and details you can see in your dwarves.

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,860
How have you been thinking of that level of detail?
