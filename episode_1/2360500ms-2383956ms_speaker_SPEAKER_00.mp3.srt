1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Well, we have actually a lot of exciting plans.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,280
So this is sort of our pilot episode.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,200
Obviously, it's not exactly how the show is

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,440
going to go in the future.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,520
But we have planned some fiction from me.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,440
I am actually a professional writer of words.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,520
It may not sound like it as I'm speaking,

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:30,080
but I do that for a living at times.
