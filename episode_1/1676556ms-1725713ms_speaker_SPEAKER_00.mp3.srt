1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
This time I locked the door.

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,200
There were still quite a few people outside,

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,400
which was a little concerning to me.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,520
But I had a very small squad.

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,800
They'd done some training, and I was finally like,

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,480
all right, it's now or never, we gotta open the door.

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,000
And that was a terrible, terrible, very, very bad idea.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,980
And at that point, you could see the population

9
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,960
of my fort ticking down by the constant new mayors.

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,640
And these cave crocodiles just kept going.

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,360
And we looked at them a couple of times,

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,640
and I think Drew noticed that one of them

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,520
was not actually a cave crocodile.

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,080
It was the scales of a cave crocodile.

15
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,000
So it's the zombie scales, like a skin, I'm assuming,

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,200
dragging itself around, murdering people.

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,720
And then there was the arm of a dwarf,

18
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,600
which I'm sure for the dwarves that it killed

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,200
was pretty disturbing.
