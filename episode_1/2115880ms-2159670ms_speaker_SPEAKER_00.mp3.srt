00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Right. I don't know that the game necessarily distinguishes in that nothing has happened

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,760
in a while. I think that it's more or less actually random, but it does have a built-in

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,880
passage of time and you are guaranteed certain events. So at this point you are going to turn

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:25,120
into an old man, Sim. And time does pass in Dwarf Fortress, but nothing is constant fort to fort.

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,560
So you're not going to see the same changes as time passes. And because of the way that you're

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,720
playing the world and not individual forts, that passage of time isn't necessarily even seen in

7
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,280
your current save. You might not see the pattern of things until you go into that Legends mode and

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:53,840
see what else is there and happening.
