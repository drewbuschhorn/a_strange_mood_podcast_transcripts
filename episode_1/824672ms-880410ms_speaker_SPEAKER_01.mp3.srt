00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
It's very easy that, again, in being able to choose what layer you drop down into in Dwarf Fortress,

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,500
it's very easy to miss interesting things going on on lower levels than what you're even aware exists.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,500
So, Sword Begins. I'll continue on with that.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,500
Sure.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,000
So that was part of the Ceilings of Combat civilization.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:37,500
And the main dwarf of interest in Sword Begins was Reg Matkib, or Ben Nutz, and she was the Baroness slash Countess by the end of the existence of Sword Begins.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:49,000
She was of unknown parentage, and she basically rose from almost nothing to Baroness Countess of Sword Begins over the course of about four years.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,500
Years are kind of both very long in Dwarf Fortress and then don't seem to be very long for what happens in them.
