1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
So after the first forgotten beast, we then had our second forgotten beast.

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,660
Um, I'm not going to try to say the names.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,300
A huge chicken with, uh, uh, with lidless eyes.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,980
It has a stubby horn and it squirms and fidgets.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,100
It's light brown feathers are long and narrow.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:16,680
Beware.

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,500
It's poisonous.

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,220
Sting.

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,820
Stinging chicken.

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,780
We dealt with that one pretty quick at that point because we had gotten, we had

11
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,600
had a little bit of time between the first one we were able to get people trained up

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,980
a little bit enough to fight that.

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,380
Then in the same month, the forgotten beast Ascombe has come a towering

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,580
feathered click beetle.

15
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,020
It has a square shell and a bloated body.

16
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,180
It's Auburn feathers are long and sparse.

17
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:40,620
Beware.

18
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,300
It's poisonous.

19
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:41,800
Bite.

20
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,460
Actually that one we killed in like one fight.

21
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:59,700
And that was another Chur geek that was taken down with one blow and

22
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:07,260
they are going to deal with that super Tad Eggman.

23
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,160
Okay, so we've got three shorted beasts left, one weakness, then
