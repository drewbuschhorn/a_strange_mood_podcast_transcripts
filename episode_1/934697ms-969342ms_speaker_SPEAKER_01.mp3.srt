1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
And after about two years of good progress towards making the glass fortress

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,400
and building out glass turrets and everything out in the ocean, good success there,

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,200
we apparently started to wake up forgotten beasts.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,900
Forgotten beasts are a thing that are created at the start of a door fortress world.

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:25,000
There's usually somewhere in the range of like 200 or 300 maybe total.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,600
And they exist down in the bowels of the earth and only become aware of you

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:48,600
if you start making noise or break into their territories.
