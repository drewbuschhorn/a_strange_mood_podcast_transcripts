1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
And other times you may get to a place that didn't even look that promising,

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,900
but you dig down two layers and you start finding platinum and gold everywhere.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:14,400
I had one fortress that never even tried to do farming at it,

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,400
to make plump elements and make dwarven wine and all of that.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,400
Instead, we had gold basically one layer down, just the seams of it.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:23,900
Wow.

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,500
And so we just made gold crafts and traded everything for that,

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,000
and that fort did pretty decently.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,500
Now that was back in one of the older versions.

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,000
Right.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,500
But yeah, so it's always open to you to decide what you're going to specialize in,

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:47,500
or if not open to you for anything, it's open to you to figure out,

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,500
with the resources I have on hand, what am I going to do.

14
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,000
Right.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Each game is different.
