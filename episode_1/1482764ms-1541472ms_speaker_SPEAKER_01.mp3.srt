1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
That is the current history of the Dimensions of Myth.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,640
Those are the major events for my forts.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,640
But meanwhile, a whole other series of events

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,880
have been occurring within the fortress,

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,800
within the Dimensions of Myth,

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,000
which when you retire a fortress,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,320
or one fails like Sword Begins did,

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,880
then you can pull up what's called Legends Mode,

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,280
which basically lets you view the entire history of your world

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,800
as has happened so far,

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,720
including all of the civilizations

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,320
that you haven't interacted with.

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,960
For an example, besides apparently the goblins

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,040
in the Dimensions of Myth,

15
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,400
we do seem to have a problem with kidnapping necromancers,

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,000
necromancers who kidnap people,

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,680
and then convert the people they've kidnapped

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,680
into kind of white walkers or some sort of...
