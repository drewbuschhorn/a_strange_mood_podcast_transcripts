00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
I guess so. And at one point I went and she was just snoozing in her bedroom.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,560
And then I followed her around for a little while and she did eventually get

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,760
murdered. She was not the last to get murdered.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,680
I think, again, it was either.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,240
No, it was a bard. It wasn't a child.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:12,920
A visiting bard.

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,680
It was a visiting bard who was the last to die.

8
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:31,720
I bet he's really glad that he went to Treasure Trees.
