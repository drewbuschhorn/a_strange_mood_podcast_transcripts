00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Ultimately it was my fault for choosing that spot.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,560
So in some ways I think that the game requires more

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,120
of the player in that what happens

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,560
is a consequence of your choices,

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,720
but also you do have to bring a level of creativity to it

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,120
in order to see patterns and to get attached

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:30,120
to particular dwarves or see the stories that are emerging.
