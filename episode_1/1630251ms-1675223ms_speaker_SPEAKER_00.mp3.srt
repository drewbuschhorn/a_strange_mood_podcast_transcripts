00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
get murdered. I mean, they'd do some... they'd try to do some murder. I think they might

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:09,840
have killed, like, a bard who was gathering silk or whatever in the caverns, but for the

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,360
most part, we just murdered them, put them out in the refuse pile. Putting them outside

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:20,320
in the refuse pile, apparently, big, big mistake, because some goblin necromancer turned all

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:28,080
of those dead cave crocodiles into zombies, which then started to attack my fort. This

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,400
fort was actually great. My current fort is not far from it, and I'm like, can I reclaim

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,300
it? But it's close to the goblins, unfortunately, and I'm definitely not prepared to venture

8
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:43,080
up there. But I built into the side of a mountain, so I had one door going in, and when bad things

9
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:57,760
came, I would just lock the door. We'd stay in there.
