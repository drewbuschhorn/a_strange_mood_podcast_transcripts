1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Yeah, so at that stage I was like,

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,460
I feel like I've got a handle on the new interface

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,760
and also I'm not dealing with this anymore.

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,760
And so I retired that fort.

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,520
So what retiring a fort means is that you're designating

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,700
this fort to now be controlled back by the world

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,060
in the normal flow of the game.

8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,480
And so then after you do that,

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,860
you can go and choose and create a new fort

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,920
or take over another fort that you had retired previously

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,200
or that just existed in the world

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,860
but had been abandoned because of reasons.

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,600
So after that, for my second fort in the Dimensions of Myth,

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,080
I created Fortress Hatchet Basin.

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,360
Nope, nope.

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,360
I created Fortress Hatchet Basin.
