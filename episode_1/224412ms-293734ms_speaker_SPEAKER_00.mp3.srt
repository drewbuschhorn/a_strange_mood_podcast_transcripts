1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
You know, I'm still I feel like I'm still kind of learning my way around in in this world.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,480
But I do enjoy checking in.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,880
And I remember I had one my first fort.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,920
People got fae moods just just constantly like that was the only thing that was interesting

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,800
about that fort until I later abandoned it.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,800
But there was a child who had gotten into a fae mood and it was after he saw someone who

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,280
had gone into a fae mood and didn't have what they need and went berserk and got murdered.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,480
And he was just permanently unhappy after that.

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,920
And I just sort of kept an eye on him as things went on and thinking he would do something

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,920
interesting and make a bracelet or whatever it was that he made.

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,280
And he didn't really. And I did eventually abandon that fort because I felt like I had

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,600
my feet under me a little bit better.

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,720
But in the next one, I don't think that I followed individuals quite as much.

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,320
And I am only a little bit into my third fort.

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,120
And I'm still considering kind of what what my angle of approach is going to be, if it's

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:01,840
going to be individual story level or the whole fort or just pursuing the goals of things

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,360
that I need to learn. It's open ended, which is, I mean, foreshadowing a little bit of

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:26,360
what we'll talk about later in this episode.
