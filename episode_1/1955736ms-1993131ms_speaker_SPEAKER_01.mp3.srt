1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
But there's not really like a win condition.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,200
I believe nominally you can get your fort

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,780
to become so valuable and so politically important

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,800
that it becomes the center of your civilization.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,840
But even then, you can still just then keep playing

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,640
as the center of your civilization

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,560
and civilization's the thing.

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,840
So I think calling it a game isn't quite the right word.

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,600
The other thing as well is we talked about in the beginning

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,320
that kind of all simulation games

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,700
since Dwarf Fortress first kind of became popular

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:57,500
are measured to one degree or another against Dwarf Fortress.
