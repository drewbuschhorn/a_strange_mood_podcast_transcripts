00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
That's correct. When you start a game in Dwarf Fortress, it's not actually the fort that you hear people talking about,

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:14,340
but rather it's the entire world that you're creating, and you will create multiple forts within that world over the course of the game.

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:21,760
For mine, the world is called the Dimension of Myths, and it is a

4
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,200
not super great for Dwarves world that, as

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,560
it starts, is kind of overrun by Goblins. It's just infested.

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:39,520
Yeah, it's infested left and right, because you look at the map that it generates, and you can see, you know, Goblin pits and Dwarven

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,360
civilizations, Elf civilizations, human civilizations, and all their locations, and the Goblins are just getting out of control.

8
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:57,800
So that's something that I think my Dwarves are going to have to learn to deal with.
