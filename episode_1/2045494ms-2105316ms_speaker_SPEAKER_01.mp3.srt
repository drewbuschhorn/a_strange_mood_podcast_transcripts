I think that's fair. I think it's also interesting to kind of talk about how Dwarf Fortress differs from The Sims, for example.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
There's another game called RimWorld that's very popular that also is... RimWorld is obviously a descendant of Dwarf Fortress.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Something in that same vein. But where, again, they've taken Dwarf Fortress and for RimWorld turned it into more of a game.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What I mean by that is that it's focused around providing the player with entertainment in a way that Dwarf Fortress isn't.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Dwarf Fortress expects you to find some fun, but it doesn't change itself to give you that fun.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:52,000
RimWorld, and I believe The Sims as well, when things aren't happening, the game will change a rule, basically.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It'll make a decision on its own that, okay, I'm going to add this complexity in.
