1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
That's a fun part of necromancy in Dwarf Fortress is that basically almost everything can be

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,440
necromanced back into a zombie.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,420
So that includes arms, you can have fingers.

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,420
Probably teeth.

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,040
I don't know if you can zombify teeth.

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,360
I'm going to keep an eye out for it.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,080
Yeah, I would watch out for that too.

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:25,000
I think it has to have, with the way Dwarf Fortress models things so carefully, I think

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,600
they have to have some means of locomotion.

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,600
But then the scales.

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,600
I mean the scales, yeah.

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,600
Yeah, I don't know.

13
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,600
I think it's a good thing.

14
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,600
Yeah.
