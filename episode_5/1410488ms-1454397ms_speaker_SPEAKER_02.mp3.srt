00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,560
Yeah, and we do have a sort of secret second entrance that involves a waterfall and my

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:14,080
not building walls. And I've had some dwarves come back in from the zombies after I've locked

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,360
the hatch, but they don't seem to go out that way. So maybe it's inaccessible to go out,

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,800
but you can come in. But then you'd think the invaders would come in. So now those zombies

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,400
are just camped out out there. They kill all the scholars who come to visit because I finally have

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,080
a library. I didn't even mention that. So I don't think that those scholars are being turned into

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,720
zombies. So either that necromancer doesn't care or the necromancer got bored and wandered away,

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:54,160
and now I'm just stuck with more zombies, but these aren't friendly.
