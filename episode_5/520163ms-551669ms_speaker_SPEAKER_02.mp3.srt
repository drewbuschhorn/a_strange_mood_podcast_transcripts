1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
For these, I just banished them.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,260
I didn't get a linked location until later.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,840
Everyone was getting happier.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,220
Then we had another invasion,

5
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,420
but this was just some vile force of darkness,

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,720
I think they were called.

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,720
And that's when I learned that hatches in the ground are OP.

8
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,380
Those are OP.

9
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,840
So the only entrance to my fort that people seem to find

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,760
is they hatch in the ground, you lock it,

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,600
they don't get in.

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,000
They just sort of mill around for a while being angry

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and leave.
