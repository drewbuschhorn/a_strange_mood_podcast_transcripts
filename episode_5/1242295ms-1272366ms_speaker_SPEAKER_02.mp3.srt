1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
Well, it was a little foreshadowing.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,580
Whoops.

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:08,880
Um, but before that we had some good news and she got made Baroness.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:09,720
Excellent.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,280
Which was so exciting because I hadn't had that happen.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,640
No baronies for me yet.

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,180
And then the dwarves elected her mayor.

8
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,240
So she was both mayor and Baroness.

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,000
Nice.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,300
She was quite powerful and she had a little bit of time to do some edicts and

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,120
mostly she just wanted us to make coins.

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,160
I don't know what we're going to do with those coins.

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,760
We have like nine or 10 of them now.
