1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,920
That's unfortunate.

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:01,420
Yeah.

3
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:04,260
I've had a couple of those elk birds roaming around,

4
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,420
and they're kind of cute.

5
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:05,980
They are.

6
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,880
Their spread's very antlery, and they have surprisingly long

7
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:30,420
legs.
