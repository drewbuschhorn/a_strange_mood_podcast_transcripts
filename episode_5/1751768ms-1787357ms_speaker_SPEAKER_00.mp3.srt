00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
So they improve your standing in your civilization and are part of the promotion system.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,360
Okay.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,240
To take another run at what I tried to explain last week,

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:18,080
there are basically two separate tracks of Ford importance and nobility.

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,720
Yeah.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,800
Nobility is completely controlled by how many of those linked economic sites you have,

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:32,960
either founded by your people or conquered and subjugated or defeated to the point that

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,360
they become utterly dependent on you.

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:45,360
Right.
