1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
of things.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Oh, okay.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Well, we can trade back and forth a little bit because I have a whole lot to talk about

4
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,680
happening from the Wondrous Planets, specifically Ragdreams, which is still my third fort.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:17,320
I think we've been going for more than five years, so it's doing okay in that way.

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,640
So when I left off last week, everyone was really mad because we'd had that whole wear

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,680
monitor thing and then some zombie wear monitors and just some zombies.

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,200
So I was trying to figure out ways to make everyone less angry.

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:36,580
So I did some banishing of the angriest, especially after one guy had a tantrum and knocked over

10
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,560
a pedestal that had an artifact on it.

11
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,320
I'm not entirely sure what happened to that artifact after that happened.

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,320
I think it might be in a storage bin.

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,400
Hopefully someone picked it up who wasn't a thief because we've had some of that happen

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,400
too.
