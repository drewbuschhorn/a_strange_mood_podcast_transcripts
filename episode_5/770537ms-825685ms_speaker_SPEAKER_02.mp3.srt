00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,100
Right, but I think I might have also found like just rose gold rose gold somewhere

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:11,240
so if you are listening to this and you know the story of rose gold or you can save us a Google and tell us and

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,480
Before I swap back to you and then we swap back and you get the biggest news update from rag dreams

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,720
I have to say the bat people man those freaking bat people. I think that we're approaching a hundred dead bat people

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:32,340
They just keep swarming up from the caverns and at first they were they were sniping dwarves kind of because you know

6
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,940
It's the caverns. There's lots of corners and lots of people down there gathering cave spider silk and they just get murdered

7
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,940
so

8
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,900
Finally, I was smart and had my squad do a patrol down there

9
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,380
So now every time I get the notification about the bat people, I just send them down to patrol

10
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:54,940
They take care of business and come back and down in the caverns is like a bat people graveyard

11
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,940
you
