00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
Yeah, I think you'll be able to identify it pretty easily once you start looking for it,

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,560
because it really is studded with a lot of different types of diamonds and sapphires

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,280
and all that sort of thing.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,680
But the challenge is that when you dig into that, it's usually got both water and magma

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,340
around inside of it.

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,280
So as you dig through, you'll get different pockets, along with either forgotten beasts

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:35,280
or giant beasts.
