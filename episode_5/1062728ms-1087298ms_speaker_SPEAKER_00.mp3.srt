I would tend to think that people have better things to do at their time.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,880
But that's been the fun with magma and water.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:13,000
The other thing I did was to deal with that whole issue, I worked on draining my level

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,880
of water and magma.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:22,160
And the way to do that basically is to carve out levels using the dig option, using the

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,160
channel option.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,160
Yes, you had to dig.

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,160
Thank you.
