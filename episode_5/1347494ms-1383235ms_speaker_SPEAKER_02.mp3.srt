1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
I think I might have one.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:08,080
I have a spearman who was very upset and canceling everything because they couldn't find their

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,780
child, their infant.

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:15,120
And so I went to look for their infant and realized it had become a ghost.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,600
So a ghost.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,600
Yes.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,120
So I'm going to look into that spearman and see what's going on there.

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,600
I don't remember how the baby died.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,640
Like we've had a lot going on.

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,040
So I'm going to try to figure out what happened to that baby and see where we're at.

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,120
I keep fixating on the tragedies, but I mean with a fort like this, what else are you going

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:55,760
to fixate on?
