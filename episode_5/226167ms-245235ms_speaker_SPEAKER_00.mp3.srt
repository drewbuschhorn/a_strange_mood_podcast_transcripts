00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
That meant that Lore's rival, Ushat, our previously baron, was now upgraded to a count.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Ooh!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And of course his wife, a countess.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yes.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
As a result, I'm pretty sure that Lore did spend some time grumbling to himself that Ushat catches all the breaks.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yeah.
