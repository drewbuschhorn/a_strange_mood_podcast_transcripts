1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
The thing you could do there is use cage traps.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,800
As we've talked about, cage traps are way overpowered at this stage.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,840
And so you could set up like, you know, 20 cage traps in a corridor,

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,040
block it off with the walls so that they have to walk through there,

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:33,760
and then open the hatch, send out a sacrificial one or two of the super angry people as part of a militia.
