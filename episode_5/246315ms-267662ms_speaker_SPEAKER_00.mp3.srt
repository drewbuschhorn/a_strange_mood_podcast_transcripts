As part of the upgrade to a county, we also had a visit from the Goblin Lord, Udyll Drivenclosers,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,600
who I'm assuming maybe came from Dungsville?

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,200
Maybe he fled or maybe he betrayed Dungsville to lore, I'm not entirely sure.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:33,200
But the interesting thing about him is he had, as one of his items, a goblin hair bracelet.
