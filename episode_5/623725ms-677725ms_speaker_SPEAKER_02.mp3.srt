1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Well, they could leave and not make my fort ugly because the entrails hanging out and

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,240
she just walks around like the same five tiles.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,440
It's yucky.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,080
But most of my resident zombies are not yucky.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,400
I don't see their entrails for the most part.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:22,480
The artifact that the one made is Ishen Thod, a tower cap mushroom wood door depicting Kogan

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,760
Cobalt tattooed ascending to position of king of the robust boulders, which I believe is

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,760
something from our history because it had the year four on it.

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,000
And I have not interacted with the robust builders that I know of.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Fair enough.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yeah.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,040
So we also had a lot of other artifacts made by normal dwarfs.

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:48,080
I think the an upside of unhappiness is that we get a lot of strange strange moods.

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,280
But then some of those have been stolen because we have a thief problem that I can't seem

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,280
to solve.
