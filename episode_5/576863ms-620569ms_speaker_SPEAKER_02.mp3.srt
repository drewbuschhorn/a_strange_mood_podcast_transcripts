1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
I guess we'll come back another day.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,860
But that was just, that one was pretty minor.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:10,660
The main thing that has been happening still after my last fort is zombies.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,660
So many zombies.

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,280
You remember that I lost my last fort to zombies.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,780
I had zombies here and I was wondering about the zombies that just sort of hang around

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,500
outside being, they're friendly, but I can't tell them to do anything.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,080
Whereas I have some zombies that are a part of my civilization.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,080
They're productive.

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,280
There's one that's a master weaver who does most of my clothes making and another one

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,920
made us an artifact actually.

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,040
Fair enough.

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,420
But the ones that are outside, they're just friendly.

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,140
They don't seem to belong to me or to anyone.

15
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,700
And I can't do anything about them.

16
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:56,540
They're just hanging out out there at the entrance with their guts hanging out.
