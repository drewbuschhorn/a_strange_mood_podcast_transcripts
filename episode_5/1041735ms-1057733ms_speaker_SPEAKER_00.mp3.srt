I don't think it's true in real life.

I don't think if you put a diamond in magma, it will actually be destroyed.

00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,160
I do know that if you put it in liquid oxygen, they can be, because they're just carbon and

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,760
they go to carbon dioxide.

00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:31,280
But I don't think lava.
