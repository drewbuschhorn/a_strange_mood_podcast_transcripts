00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Yeah, fair enough. When to end the podcast? When you run out of things to say.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,180
Exactly.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,760
On that note, we do have some housekeeping to take care of because after this episode,

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,320
we are going to go to an every other week schedule. That'll give us both more time to

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,160
actually play the game and build up some narratives, give me time to write shorter

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,520
stories, and give me time to do some Twitch streaming.

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:29,840
Yeah, I think so.
