1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
And the turn-based at first was kind of off-putting,

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,520
but it works pretty well as a gameplay loop

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,080
because you will know how many days you have

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,400
until the good or bad event happens.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,100
So it can be very easy to be like,

6
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,600
okay, I'll do another day and then I'll go to bed.
