Mm-hmm, and people to play with who aren't weird and full of drama.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,600
So that cracked my resolve a little, and then seeing people talk about it on release day

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:17,520
and talk about their characters, I finally just caved. And you were still stalwart,

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,960
you were not going to play it. But then you saw some of my play, and then saw a streamer that we

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,440
day nine watched the intro video, and there's a lot of Spelljammer stuff in there. And

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,600
that's, I think, when you caved.
