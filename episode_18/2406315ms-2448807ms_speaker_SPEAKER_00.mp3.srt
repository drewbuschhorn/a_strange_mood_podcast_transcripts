1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
All right, wet ringed, wet ringed.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:02,640
Wet ringed.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,160
So if you skipped that section, welcome back.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,480
Or I guess you were here all along.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,440
I don't know.

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,320
At any rate, news from wet ringed.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,240
I also did not play a lot of Dwarf Fortress this week,

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,720
but I did play enough to have a few updates.

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,480
We're around 100 dwarves.

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,080
And as kind of a footnote to our last episode,

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,000
I had both the Farmers Guild and the Miners Guild

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,640
request upgrades to a Grand Guild Hall,

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,480
which needed to be valued at 10,000 dwarf bucks.

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,280
So I had to put in like gold flooring

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,320
and more silver statues and things like that.
