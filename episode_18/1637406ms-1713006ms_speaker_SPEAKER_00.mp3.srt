1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
Yeah. Are people racist? A little bit. Yeah, as a tiefling, I've encountered some in-game racism,

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,080
especially at the beginning sequence with the druids, because they were in direct conflict

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:19,200
with some tiefling refugees, and there's an invasion from the goblins coming, and they want

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:26,160
to kick the tieflings out of their camp and just protect the grove, and you have to make some

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,880
decisions early on, like, am I on the side of the druids? Am I on the side of the tieflings? Do I

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,560
want to kill this potentially corrupt druid leader? Hell, do I want to side with the goblins

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:45,360
and take over this grove and become, you know, more or less evil? So I am not... it's funny,

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,360
like, I'm not really role-playing as, like, oh, you know, I'm playing, like, an ingenue or

9
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,320
something like that, but I'm mostly just making choices that I feel comfortable with on this first

10
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:01,760
play, and on another I will create a character with more of a personality of its own. So I opted

11
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:08,800
to... I wanted to help the tieflings, and I didn't feel good about just murdering a woman that, even

12
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,160
though she was threatening to kill a child, I didn't just feel good in this game of my first act

13
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,440
basically being murder.
