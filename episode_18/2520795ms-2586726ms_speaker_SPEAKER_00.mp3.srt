00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,920
I have not looked up the persuasive yet. So that will be to, to do be continued on the persuasive.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,920
And then my other final note is that, like, I've been feeling a little bit of dwarf burnout,

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,160
I hate to confess, but I was talking to someone in a different discord who was saying that he

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:27,360
had never seen the game. And could I share my screen? And so I did. And these three guys in

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,000
this other discord who had never played the game or watching, and hearing they're just like

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,840
overwhelmed and delight at the things in Dwarf Fortress was really, really refreshing. So like,

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,280
oh my gosh, that's your world map and like all the details. And then I was sort of doing a fort

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:50,560
tour. And they saw the many, many, many trapped creatures that I have caught in cage traps,

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,600
and then just put to the basement for lack of a better thing to do with them.

10
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,320
And was asked the question, ma'am, why do you have a gulag in your basement?

11
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,760
And then they enjoyed seeing like the thoughts of all the traumatized creatures in cages.
