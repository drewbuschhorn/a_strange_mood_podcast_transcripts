00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
And the DM has to be like, look, guys, I need you to engage.

00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,920
OK, just fly along.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,800
You're adventurers.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,400
This is what you do.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,600

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,480
by saying, hey, look, you've got x number of days

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,000
