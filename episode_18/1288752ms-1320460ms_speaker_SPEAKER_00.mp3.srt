00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
It's so clearly a larva. Larva is such a better word.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,920
Tadpole's a very silly word. It's not very scary.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,480
No.

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,040
But, uh, I mean, maybe that's some of the humor.

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,160
And the other thing that I will note about that is that it gives it a sense of urgency

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,320
to such a degree that I was asking friends, like,

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,840
Hey, do I need to, like, rush to go get this fixed?

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,080
Or can I take my time and explore and do said quests?

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,320
And they were like, You can take your time. It's fine. It's a plot beat.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,120
But yeah, so I think that maybe they oversold the urgency a tiny bit.

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,520
Yeah, it's...
