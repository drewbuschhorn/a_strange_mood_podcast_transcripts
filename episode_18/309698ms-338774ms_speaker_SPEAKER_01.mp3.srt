1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
And then I lost another 10 to a red-purple monster that we uncovered from the obsidian pillar.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,700
Mm.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,200
A very large gecko twisted into humanoid form with external ribs.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,200
It has a bloated body. Its red-purple scales are large and close set.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,200
Beware its webs! She is extremely agile and almost never sick, but she is very quick to tire.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,700
She is average in size.

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:28,700
And when she was finally murdered, Ashcrip's the Fatal's purple monster goo was what was left behind.

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,200
Ew.
