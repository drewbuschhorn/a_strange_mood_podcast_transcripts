Yeah. And it's interesting, because we we did more or less the same thing in that in that sequence,

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:15,280
but we executed it very, very differently. So like, I rescued a nicer druid guy, first,

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,520
and then with his aid, more or less, I then took out the goblin leadership and fought my way out

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:29,440
out of the fort. But I found him before killing the leadership. And then the drought had already

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,840
taken off. So I just went off to go defend the grove.
