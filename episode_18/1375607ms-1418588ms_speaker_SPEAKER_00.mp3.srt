00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
Yes, so I absolutely wanted to get moving, but didn't need to. So I am playing a tiefling,

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,480
which is like a sort of half-demon, hellspawn thing. Not actually a half-demon, but it's

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:20,800
hellspawn. Sorcerer, wild magic sorcerer. I like wild magic in D&D because of the chaos element,

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:29,360
in that you can push yourself in certain ways and possibly trigger a random magic reaction. So

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:37,200
they can be helpful or not helpful. Or in one case, I suddenly gained the ability to speak

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,800
with animals, which I didn't really need at the moment. So it was neither a help nor a hindrance.
