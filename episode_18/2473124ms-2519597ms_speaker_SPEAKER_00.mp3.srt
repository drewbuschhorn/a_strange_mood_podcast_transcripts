1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
Yeah, um, I don't know if there's any added value for the dwarves other than they're probably just

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,160
enjoying being in that environment because they always get a positive moodlet from being around

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:19,360
fancy stuff. Yeah. We also got upgraded to a barony. And I once again, had a fort in which

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:25,520
I didn't know what dwarf should be promoted. So I just sort of picked one who was happy and had

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,920
some family members because that seemed like the thing to do. You know, you're starting a dynasty

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:36,640
here. So they already have children. I chose Ral Flyer Crafted. She is married to, uh, Adal

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,920
Theaterspear. Uh, they have two children. Ral is a minor, which is appropriate for,

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,320
you know, the bareness of the dwarves. And her deity is called the Persuasive.
