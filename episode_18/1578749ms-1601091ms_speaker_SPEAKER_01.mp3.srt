1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
I like to imagine my character as kind of being a Robert De Niro-type character.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,940
You know, short, but pretty intimidating.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:15,440
So I gave him high charisma with a specialty in intimidation and deception.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:22,320
So at this stage, at level 8, I make deception rolls at something like a plus 12.
