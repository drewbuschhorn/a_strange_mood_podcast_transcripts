2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,040
gaming discord. And some of my friends there have been talking about it nonstop. And I just refused

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,760
because like, oh, it's 120 gigabytes, and I don't really have time. And you know, I have a podcast

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,960
about a different game. And then I mod a community for another game, and it's just too much. And then

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,440
I got the email from Wizards of the Coast from D&D Beyond talking about how Baldur's Gate uses 5e

00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,760
and my resolve started to crack a little bit.
