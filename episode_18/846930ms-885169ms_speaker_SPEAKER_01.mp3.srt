1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
And I think Baldur's Gate 1 was probably not what you played. I played Baldur's Gate 1

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,080
after playing Baldur's Gate 2. The last expansion for Baldur's Gate 2 was in 2001,

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,360
so that was right when I graduated. So I was playing Baldur's Gate 2 base game in like

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,120
sophomore year-ish. And then after I played that I went back and played the first one.

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:31,200
But that was even older. But yeah, the Baldur's Gate 2 was really good because you had all these

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,200
different quests that you could do. It was just something so totally different than anything

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,000
else that was really available in the CRPG stuff there.
