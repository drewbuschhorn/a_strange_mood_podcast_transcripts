Yeah, so I am it is kind of save scumming the game like my playthrough says something that I'm at like 20 hours

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:16,140
But there's a kind of a puzzle a sneaky sneaky bit later that I kept failing at and so I saved scum

3
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,300
For probably like two hours just back and back and back

4
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:25,540
So my play time in the game on Steam is like 24 or 28 hours and my campaign says it's like 21

5
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,540
Yeah
