I've had to come up with some creative ways to solve problems like the goblin leadership. I just

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,240
kept bringing the whole fort down on me in a way that it was too much to fight off,

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,400
especially with that drow. So I finally lured one of them into a room, shut the door,

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,960
and then had Asterion, the one we were talking about before, he's a rogue,

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,360
sneak behind her, stab her in the back, and then vampire bite her and kill her in not even a turn.
