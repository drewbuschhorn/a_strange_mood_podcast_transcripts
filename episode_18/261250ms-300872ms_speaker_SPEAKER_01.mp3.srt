00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,120
Yeah. So the Forgotten Beasts who arrived were Rony Aberquino, a towering three-eyed crocodile.

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,160
It has a knobby trunk and is slathering. Its aquamarine scales are blocky and close-set.

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,960
Beware its poisonous gas. Thankfully, that one didn't actually manage to get into the

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,520
fort or do really any damage. That's good, because that gas is bad.

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,520
But unfortunately, then we had the Forgotten Beast Lysh Gethen, seduced-hated.

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,440
Came a huge eyeless falcon. It has a pair of branching antennae and squirms and fidgets.

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,440
Its dark pink feathers are long and sparse. Beware its poisonous vapors.
