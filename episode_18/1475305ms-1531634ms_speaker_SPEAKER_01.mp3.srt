1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
Yeah, the options in this one are a devil, a fey, or an outer god.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,800
And an outer god is, again, Cthulhu, but not the mind flayer Cthulhu.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,200
Yes.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,480
So I chose the outer gods because I thought that sounded fun.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,000
It's kind of been interesting listening to other people talk about it, that background,

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,920
because your background plays a lot into the game.

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,240
It does.

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,120
It causes various plot beats to happen sooner or gives you different options.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,920
And other people I've heard who have chosen devil and fey, they hear from their patrons,

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,040
their warlocks, and they hear from their patrons all the time.

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,560
I have not heard a word from my patron.

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,880
Two times I've run into a situation where it says

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,160
it's given me the option to call upon my patron, and I have, and I just get a dial tone.
