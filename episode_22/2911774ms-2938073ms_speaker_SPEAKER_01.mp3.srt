Chewy. One thing that I should address in this fort is what is stored where because I think that I'm

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,560
running into things rotting in storage more than I think they should. So I need to, I know that I

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:21,360
don't have trash or corpses stored in any of them, but I'm wondering if things are degrading because

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,760
they're stored improperly. Like you don't want to store your apples near your bananas or something

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,260
like that.
