No, it is one of three unimplemented organic materials in the game.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,400
Here I'm just reading from DFWiki.

00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,000
Sure.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,200
The others being amber and pearls.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,200
Dwarves can have preference for the material.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,700
More annoying, nobles can issue demands involving these materials.

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,200

00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,200
they cannot be produced and cannot be crafted.
