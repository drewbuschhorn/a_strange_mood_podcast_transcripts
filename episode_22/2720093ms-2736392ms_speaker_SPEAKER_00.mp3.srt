1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
Yeah, well, it's one of those things like, especially when, you know, you're doing things

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,500
like I'm not particularly good at electronics, but I do electronic stuff.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,840
So it winds up taking a lot of time for programming, like I'm not particularly a great programmer

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,720
and I'm doing programming projects and it just winds up taking a lot of time, but it's

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,240
satisfying.
