00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And so you collect this rain and you use it to enhance your various buildings and all that.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
But the thing is that the rain actually, to me, doesn't feel that big of an impact in the game.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It just sort of is there.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And even though one thing that happens in the course of a year in the game is the storm,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
which is where the rain really starts pelting down and everyone's resolve drops and everyone's unhappy about it.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And no joke.
