1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
It really does.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,840
And same for the way the resource management

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,240
is kind of held because there's all these different

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,880
unique ones and you're trading them.

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,840
And again, the trading in here would make more sense

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,960
if you were playing it with three other people, kind of,

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,520
and you could trade for what you need

8
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,980
a little bit more efficiently.

9
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,400
So I think there's a lot of board game influence.

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,160
Just makes me think a little bit of like Armello,

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,480
which was a video game that the designers talked a lot

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,400
about how he initially designed it as a board game

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,880
or played it as a board game before trying to code it.

14
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,800
I get that feeling here.

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,560
Like this feels like a lot of the mechanics

16
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,720
that don't make a whole lot of sense

17
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,600
from a video game city builder point of view

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,440
would make more sense as a board game.

19
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,160
So some other mechanics that just kind of show

20
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,240
the complexity of this and how you have so many

21
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:54,240
intersecting pieces are that as the game goes on,

22
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,520
you unlock more buildings, as we talked about.

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,280
Cornerstones, which are kind of bonuses

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,520
that you can choose from the queen.

25
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:09,520
Again, well, you know, I think those, the cornerstones,

26
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,360
do actually have a pretty big game impact frequently.

27
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:26,860
Yeah, that is an interesting point too,
