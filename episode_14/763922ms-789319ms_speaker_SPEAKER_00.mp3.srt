1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
But the interesting part is that when you do something that makes the queen happy,

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:12,100
it not just gives you renown, but it also removes a bar from the queen's impatience.

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:18,100
And also, there are at the higher level things that you can mess up that cause you to lose a chunk of renown,

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,200
and then that just slides over into the queen's impatience.

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:31,200
And so you've got this push-pull constantly with every decision you make in this game.
