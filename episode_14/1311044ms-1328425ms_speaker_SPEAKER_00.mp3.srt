1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,960
Exactly.

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,480
And not just in the tutorial itself,

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,240
because the tutorial is that sort

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,200
of segregated initial experience,

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,440
but also frequently the tool tips and stuff

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,440
will link out to the wiki.

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,240
And I'm like, no, man, I'm playing the game.

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,560
I don't want to go read a wiki.
