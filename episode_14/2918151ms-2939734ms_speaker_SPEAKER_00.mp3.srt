00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,600
And I want to see other people also take this ball and run with it, because again, I would like a little bit easier one, honestly.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:33,600
I would like a roguelike city builder that I could pound through a run in 45 minutes.
