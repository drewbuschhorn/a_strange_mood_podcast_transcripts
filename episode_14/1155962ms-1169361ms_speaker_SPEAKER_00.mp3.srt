1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
And was like, huh, this is pretty easy,

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,000
but also like I'm not really leveling up or anything.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm not getting much XP.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,520
And then I realized that the lowest difficulty level,

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:32,520
you have a XP modifier of like one quarter.
