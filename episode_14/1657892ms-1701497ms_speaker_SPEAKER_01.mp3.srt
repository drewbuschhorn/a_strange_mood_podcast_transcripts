00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,340
I see what you're saying, but I think that the barrier in my head is more that it's hard

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:15,560
to walk away in the middle of a particular run, because you are juggling a lot of mechanics,

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:21,720
and it could be easy to forget that, like, oh, I need to turn off making packs of building

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,040
materials because I need planks for building such, or for a delivery.

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,200
And if I take a break in the middle of my hour and 45 minute run and come back to it

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,360
in two days, I'm not going to remember.

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,360
So I'm not really, it sounds strange to say that I'm not hung up on the duration of a

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,360
run.

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:56,320
I don't seem to be able to save and quit out if I need to, you know?
