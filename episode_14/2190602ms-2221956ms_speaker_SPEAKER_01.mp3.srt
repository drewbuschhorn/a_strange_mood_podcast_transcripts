00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Yes, it's... I should have taken a screenshot actually when I did a run today because I looked

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:11,840
at those modifiers and was like, I... those are all doing things that I'm only vaguely aware of.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,520
Like if it's not, you know, speed of woodcutters, then I'm...

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,480
Or cannibalism.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,280
Or... well, I have never chosen cannibalism. I have not had a lot of villagers leave or die.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,640
Fair enough.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,440
I have been really lucky with my dangerous glades, is what I'm saying.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:27,940
Yeah.

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,300
Um, because those... those will kill your villagers.
