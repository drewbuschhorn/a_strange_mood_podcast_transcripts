1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,700
Yes, and one of the exciting things

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,980
that we actually talk about a lot in the episode

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,780
is that on their roadmap,

4
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,580
they have some tutorial improvements.

5
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,900
And that was one of our biggest critiques of the game,

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,860
that it didn't really teach you

7
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:31,860
in a way that we want it to be taught.
