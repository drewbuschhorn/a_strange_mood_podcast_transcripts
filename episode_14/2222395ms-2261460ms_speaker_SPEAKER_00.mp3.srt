00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
Yeah, the game I lost was because I opened up a dangerous glade and it had a corrupted

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:14,720
rain punk, steam punk, giant mecha thing in it which I was able to defeat but by the time I

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:20,160
defeated it, it had caused so much poison around things that my villagers were all unhappy and I

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,560
kind of was in from Dwarf Fortress a tantrum spiral basically. And so I was able to kind of

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,160
stabilize each time just as the storm started up again everyone's resolve went down everyone went

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,920
angry and so I kind of got stuck in that loop until time just ran out on me and the queen's

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:56,400
impatience filled up.
