1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
It did not take me less than 30 minutes.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,760
It took me longer.

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,240
And when I came out of it,

4
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,840
I still really had no idea what was going on.

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,200
And granted, I was not paying that much attention

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,040
to the tutorial,

7
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,920
because you were streaming Dwarf Fortress at the time,

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,040
and it was amusing.

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,960
So I was just, you know,

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,320
half paying attention to my own tutorial.

11
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,680
But I came out of there like pretty unclear

12
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:31,680
on what the win condition of the game was.
