1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Because in order to complete a lot of the Glade challenges,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
which are where you dig into a particular corner and have this option to do something challenging for a big reward,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
a lot of those, the only way to resolve them are with tools.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Or at least that used to be the case.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The most recent release, they changed it from only being able to solve most of those with tools

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
to also then being able to use some more common resource for a lesser reward.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Thank goodness.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But yeah, when those were only tools, that was a real pain.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Because I frequently would wind up with like 12 tools total and you need 12 for a big Glade challenge usually.
