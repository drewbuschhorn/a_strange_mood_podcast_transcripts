1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
And then, but those also then factor into,

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,080
both the buildings and the cornerstones

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,240
factor into the delivery mechanics,

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,120
which are part of how you get the reputation

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,600
to the renowned to complete a run.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,240
So you really need to hit those deliveries.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,600
And if you don't get the right combination

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,560
of buildings, cornerstone, and trade,

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,080
and resources and all that,

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,680
sometimes you just can't hit those.

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,360
And so then you have to go to your secondary win condition,

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,200
which again was something not super emphasized

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,200
in the tutorial of the resolve of your villagers, right?

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,600
Because if your villagers have the resolve

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,600
above a certain level, which is different for each race.
