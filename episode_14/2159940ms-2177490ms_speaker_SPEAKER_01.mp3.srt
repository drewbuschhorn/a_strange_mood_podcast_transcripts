00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Right. When am I going to open? How difficult of a glade? And what's the timing on this? Because

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,720
like if you open something that's going to affect resolve, you don't really want that to happen

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,880
during a storm because that's taking resolve down too. And also you can get bonuses based

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:32,400
on the time of year that you open a particular glade.
