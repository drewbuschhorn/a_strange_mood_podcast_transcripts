00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
Okay, so the premise of this game is that you are a Viceroy, which is to say, kind of a landlord,

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:17,040
who is being sent out by the queen of a fantasy realm that is being periodically ravaged by

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,600
storms. And you're being sent out to found cities to gather resources with any of the

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:29,200
currently five playable races that recently changed from four to head out, gather resources

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:35,760
to bring back to the Citadel, your home base. Because as part of the post-apocalyptic nature

6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,520
of the game, every so often a giant storm will come through and wipe out all of the cities that

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,880
you've made. And this is the way in which it's kind of roguelike, because you build up an area,

8
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,560
but then those cities get destroyed and you start again, but you have new abilities and

9
00:00:52,560 --> 00:01:01,920
resources that you've gained over the course of the previous run.
