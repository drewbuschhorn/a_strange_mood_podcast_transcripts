1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Yes, yeah, yeah, they're achievements.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,800
They're basically team achievements.

3
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,200
Yes, and you get additional XP for that.

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,040
I only got one of those this run,

5
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,160
and I really did not get a lot of XP.

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,920
However, I did get a lot of the bread,

7
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,560
which is how you purchase Citadel upgrades.

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,980
And so I was able to get a couple of things

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,360
that will make life easier for me,

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,280
including getting an additional option to select from

11
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:27,280
for buildings and that, so.
