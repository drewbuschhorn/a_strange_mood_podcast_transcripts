00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
You might like this.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,960
Yeah, that makes sense.

3
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,040
Either way.

4
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,000
And you played it earlier than I did,

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,120
so a couple of patches ago.

6
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:31,680
What was your onboarding experience like in this game?
