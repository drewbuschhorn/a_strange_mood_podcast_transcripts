1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
So there are beavers, there are humans,

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,600
there are lizards, harpies, and now foxes.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,440
Foxes!

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,480
And some of them are very cute,

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,560
and since rain is a,

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,320
this is sort of a player versus nature game as well,

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,320
they walk around in little raincoats.

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,140
Yeah.

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,560
And the humans kinda look like pill bugs.

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,320
Each race has different bonuses to their abilities.

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,680
They also have likes and dislikes,

12
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,480
so some like certain food,

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,680
some do better at certain jobs,

14
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,400
but also they like certain jobs different,

15
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,000
so you are balancing their needs and their wants.
