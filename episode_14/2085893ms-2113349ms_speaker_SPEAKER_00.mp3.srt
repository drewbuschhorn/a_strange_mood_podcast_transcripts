00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
So what feels more real of an influence in the game to me is actually the forest.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:06,980
Yeah.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:14,080
Because the forest, its anger continually increases as you chop down wood, which you have to do.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,580
Yeah.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,040
But also you choose the speed at which you chop down wood.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,360
And then as the forest becomes angrier, the glades, when you open them up, have, you know,

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,720
worse and worse penalties. And also open...

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,680
Better and better roads.
