Because your hearth is always consuming something.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,600

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,800
And if you sacrifice, that basically means you're like doubling or tripling.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,000
You can choose how much it's burning of that resource.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:42,100
Yeah.
