1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
not just in an asymmetric way like StarCraft does, where each race is good at one thing,

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:12,720
but rather each race is good at one thing, but also bad at another.

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:20,400
And so you're constantly balancing these two opposing tensions. Do you want your beavers to be

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,760
chopping wood, which they're really good and fast at, or do you want them to be engineering,

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,240
which they're happy doing, but they're not any faster than anybody else doing it, they're just

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,000
happier? Yeah.
