00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
But I've lost two runs that I've been playing to updates happening between when I saved it and came back to it.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,200
And it's like, hey, we did an update, so we finished off your run for you.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,300
Here's like double the rewards you would have gotten and no XP.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,700
And once again, I'm like, I kind of want the XP.

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,000
Like, I want to finish this off.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So that one kind of frustrated me, especially when it happened a second time.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I was a little frustrated.
