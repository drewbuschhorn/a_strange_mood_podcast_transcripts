Yeah, and I mean this is the thing. We would like to talk more about city builders, but eventually

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,120
we'll have to figure out a format rather than just... But anyway, here we are. So the dynamic

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,640
tension that I love so much about this game, um, is that it's a dynamic tension that's not

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,440
just about the city, but it's about the dynamic tension that's about the city itself. And so

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,080
I think that's what's so interesting about this game, is that it's not just about the city,
