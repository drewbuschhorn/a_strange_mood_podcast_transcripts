Fair enough. All right. So background information. Against the Storm is a game from

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:15,040
Ermite Studios and published by Hooded Horse Games. Ermite Studios is a European game company. Some

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,360
guys who've actually worked in some pretty cool places before this got together and decided to

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,560
make a game that's actually pretty original. And then Hooded Horse, their publisher,

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:32,560
has published a bunch of kind of indie weird strategy games. The most popular one that springs

00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:40,960
to my mind besides this was Terra Invicta, which is a variant of XCOM made by the people who made

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,280
the Long War mod of XCOM that takes XCOM from a game you can beat in a weekend into a game that

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:55,120
you can play for the better part of a year. Yeah.
