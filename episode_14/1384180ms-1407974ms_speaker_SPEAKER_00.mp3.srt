1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Because I feel a lot of the time in playing this that it doesn't really.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:05,860
Yeah.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,720
I enjoy playing it, but I do sometimes feel like at the end of a run,

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,880
after I've spent the better part of an hour plus,

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,380
Mm-hmm.

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:21,020
that the reward I get is really quite small in terms of actual game mechanics.

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:31,020
Like I feel accomplished, like I enjoyed my time.
