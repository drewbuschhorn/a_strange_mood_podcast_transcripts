1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
The parts, yeah. One of them does make the parts, but...

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,480
So that means you need two random unlocks and a location that has the thing you need.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:08,880
Right.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,360
And there's not really a way to force any of that.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:11,600
Yeah.

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,120
You can, as you level up, you can get the option to unlock, like,

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,160
re-rolls of different random selections, but you don't ever really get that option

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:29,520
at lower levels, any way to handle that.
