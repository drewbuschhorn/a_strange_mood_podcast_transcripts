1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
Because some buildings only function when they're...

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,840
Within, like housing.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,400
Exactly.

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:04,960
Yeah.

5
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,400
When they're within a certain radius of the hearth.

6
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,120
And to have room to do that, because one hearth can't

7
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:30,120
overlap with another hearth in their ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
