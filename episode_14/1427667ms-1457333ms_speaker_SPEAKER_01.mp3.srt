00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,080
I did a run this morning, not on the lowest setting of ease, but on, like, I guess normal.

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,600
Like instead of goo goo gaga baby, it's just normal.

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:20,320
And while I did not get a lot of XP, and that's another area that we're not even talking about

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,160
in terms of so many interacting mechanics, you get bonuses for accomplishing certain

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,960
deeds, they call them.

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,040
So these are basically one-time XP bonuses.
