00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
When I first started playing it and I saw the videos,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,440
I was like, huh, I wonder what big company,

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,600
like this has gotta be basically released

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,520
and all of that and from a big company.

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,040
And actually in the end, it's not.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,960
It's from a small group of devs.

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,580
They've just done a really excellent job with the polish.

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,420
When you play the game,

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:30,420
it really does seem like a AAA title.
