00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So I found out about this game just through Steam.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It was one of the ones recommended for if you like Dwarf Fortress, you might like this.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,500
Yeah.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,800
Actually, you know what it might not be from if you like Dwarf Fortress?

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,600
It might be if you like Terran Victa.

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,400
Okay, well, yeah, that makes sense.

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:30,400
Either way.
