1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Yeah, and basically, I think the big question for me

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,320
is whether or not our listeners would

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,240
like to continue having it be in this stream

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,000
or if they want us to kind of create a separate feed.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,320
Yeah, a different feed.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,360
We'll see how things go, if anybody actually

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,760
expresses an opinion or not.

8
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,440
I mean, you can skip this episode easily

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,000
and these episodes easily enough.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,540
Yeah.
