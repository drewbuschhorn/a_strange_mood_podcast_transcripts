1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So when the forest's aggression or hostility gets high,

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,140
or during the storm, you can make everyone happier,

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:13,580
lower the hostility by burning different resources.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:18,580
Wood basically will reduce that hostility, I think.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,700
Just starting to get into the mechanics of it.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,900
Right, we don't need to get.
