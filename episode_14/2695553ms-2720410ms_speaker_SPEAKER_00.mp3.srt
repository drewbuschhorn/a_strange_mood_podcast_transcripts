The top of the tech tree, I'm not sure what level it is, but it's high.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,960
It's at least twice, so it's at least 20 and I think it's more than 20?

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,580
I have no idea.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:19,400
But I really feel like as well, like your XP gains, it levels off a bit.

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,880
But on the other hand, I see people on Reddit who are like playing what are the equivalent

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,440
of the Paragon levels.

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,440
Yes, I also see that.
