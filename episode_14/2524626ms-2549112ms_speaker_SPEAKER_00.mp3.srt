The last piece of tension that I feel like we didn't really talk about was again how you recover from mistakes in it.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,800
Mm, yeah.

00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:15,100
Because I feel like one of the key, one of the key, well I don't feel like, a part of game theory, a part of theory of games.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,300
You want to take it again?

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,700
A part of the theory of games.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,200
Yes.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:31,200
To distinguish it from game theory which is this whole mathematical sub-genre.
