00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
you have both a win and loss condition and they're separate

00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,620
kind of in the game in a particular run for a particular village

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,540
so you have the loss condition which is the Queen's Impatience bar

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:29,940
filling up completely.
