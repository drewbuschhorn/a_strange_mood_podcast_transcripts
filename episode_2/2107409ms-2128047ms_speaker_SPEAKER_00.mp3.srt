The nice thing about prepared meals that come from the cookery, kitchen, is that they are

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,520
faster to transport and can be stacked into barrels better. And so then the barrels full

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,640
of prepared food can be taken down to the other region more effectively than hauling individual

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,400
raw food items.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:30,400
Yeah.
