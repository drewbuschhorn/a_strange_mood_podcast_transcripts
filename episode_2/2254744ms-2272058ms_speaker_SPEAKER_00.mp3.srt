Yeah, they don't seem to care too terribly much about the quality of the mug.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,360
Obviously a nicer mug makes them happier, but you know, you need to have probably at

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,920
least one mug per dwarf throughout your entire fortress, even if they don't all wind up in

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,320
one tavern or the other.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:34,320
Then they'll use that to go, I guess, goop out.
