1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
Is that what that means?

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,800
Ignore the water droplet.

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,800
That's not what that means.

4
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,200
No, it means that they are thirsty.

5
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:06,900
Uh-huh.

6
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:30,300
But they're thirsty for alcohol, not water.
