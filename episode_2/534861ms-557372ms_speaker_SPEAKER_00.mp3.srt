00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Our mayor decided that he wanted three helms made of iron.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Mm-hmm.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And poor Rovad decided that instead of them all being made of iron,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
two of them would be made of iron and one would be made of copper.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Again, we were working with copper for the bracelets,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
so we had copper around and didn't specify a block of cloth.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yeah.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Unfortunately, this seemed to enrage the mayor.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Wow.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And he ordered his...

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:42,000
For this.
