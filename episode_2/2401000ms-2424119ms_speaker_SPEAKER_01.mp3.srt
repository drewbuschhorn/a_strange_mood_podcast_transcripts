1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
You know what my solution was?

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,260
What's that?

3
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:06,340
I didn't know about gelding in my first fort, so I had so many dogs.

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,180
There were dogs everywhere.

5
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,100
So many dogs.

6
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,260
And I started having them trained to be war dogs and hunting dogs.

7
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,860
And the war dogs took care of the crundles.

8
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,480
Unfortunately, some of the dwarves seemed to find it upsetting to have dogs

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:30,480
and crundles fighting all over the fort.
