00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,340
Oh, you absolutely can. I actually captured with a trap.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:09,100
In the military port, I'm trying to use the trap system more in Dwarf Fortress,

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,100
which is very important and surprisingly effective.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,020
Overpowered, because a good metal trap can actually capture a dragon.

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,180
That's intense.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,340
And then, when a non-sensual creature is captured,

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,300
they can be trained and then controlled as part of your fort.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,300
Nice.

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,280
So, I actually captured a careless...
