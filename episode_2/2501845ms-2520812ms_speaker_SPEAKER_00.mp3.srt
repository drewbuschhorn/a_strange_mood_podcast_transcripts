00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
I think you can.

00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And of course, Dampir.

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,400
Yeah, I think that's probably the best solution there.

00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:12,400
Of course, the right solution is to make sure that when you open up a pathway into the caverns,

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,400
you always make sure to block off all of the area and have a door, because apparently,

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:46,700
the retails can not open doors.
