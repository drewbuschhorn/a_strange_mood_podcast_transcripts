1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
And then things went really, really badly south very quickly.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,600
So we were just ticking along.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,480
I think I was in the process of starting to make luxury apartments for my dwarves.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,000
And I did the whole like building rooms vertically and you put the stairs and I was engraving

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,960
the floors and they were getting all this nice furniture.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,200
And they were everyone was actually pretty happy.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,640
I'm looking at a screenshot from when that happened and there were 53 dwarves.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,360
27 were yellow, meh, you know, totally neutral.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,560
Two were the one slightly more orange than that and everybody else happy.

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,000
They're all good.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,560
And then I got the following message.

12
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:44,360
The were monitor, fences, sybilisk, roods, okay, all right.

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,880
The were monitor has come, a large monitor twisted into humanoid form.

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,880
It is crazed for blood and flesh.

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,240
Its eyes glow green.

16
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,080
Its charcoal scales are blocky and set far apart.

17
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,360
Now you will know why you fear the night.
