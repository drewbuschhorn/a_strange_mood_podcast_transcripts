00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yeah, so Sarvesh Med Tobostov, the dwarven necromancer, we'll just call her Sarvesh moving forward,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
was out. I don't know what even she was doing. I can probably look back at who she was when I get to Legends mode.

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
She wasn't anyone remarkable, just a necromancer. She must have been out there when the Weremonitor lizard,

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
because a lot of things string together, showed up. And she started turning the dead into zombies.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So we have a whole lot of zombies in my fort now. And at first I was really freaked out and I was like,

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
shuffle around and eat the other dwarves. No, these are friendly zombies. They just kind of hang out and live.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I don't know if they work. I can click in and see if any of them are doing any jobs.
