00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
So, the Uln people. Yes, we've killed 150 Uln people in several more waves of invasions.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:12,480
I generally dispatch five fully-armored dwarves down there and take out 25 Uln people with nary a scratch.

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:19,200
But that is continuing on. It's doing pretty well.

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:28,400
In the meantime, we are also starting our invasion of the various goblin pits around Dobbed Pages.

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,400
We're up to five places invaded, four of them conquered.
