00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Well, we can use them. I think it's important to him that he sees them being put to use.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,680
Oh, okay.

00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,580
So he created a mandate for ten chains to be made and for no chains to be exported.

00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:28,580
So I made some fancy chains, we put him in the dungeons, he seems to be happy enough.
