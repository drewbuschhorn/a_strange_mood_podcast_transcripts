1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So, for the Fortress tiers, there are three, six, seven, eight.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,500
There are eight tiers there.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:17,500
Outpost, Hamlet, Village, Town, City, Metropolis, Capital, Mountain Home.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:28,800
So why is there eight tiers?

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:44,560
Because Camden is a place that has a think tank.
