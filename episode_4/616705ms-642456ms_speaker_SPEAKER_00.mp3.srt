It doesn't matter. Everything is spiraling out of control now.

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:10,840
As I was playing this afternoon, we sent our squad of angry dwarves that had been in the

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,400
torture squad off to raid another place, and nothing really happened.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,280
And then they came back, and I just sent them out again to see if maybe they could actually

00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,800
conquer it this time.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:38,440
And I guess we angered a necromancer, because then we had another zombie invasion.
