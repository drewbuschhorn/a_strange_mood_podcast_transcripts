1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
Well, things at Fort Ragdreams are not going well.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:11,600
As you recall, we had the zombie and wearer-monitor lizard invasion, and everyone was extremely

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,600
angry.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,700
Everyone who was still alive was extremely angry.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,220
So my focus has been trying to get them to be happy again.

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,360
It's not going great.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:27,480
The first thing that I did was set up a squad because we heard from Sal that military training

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,520
can perk up angry dwarves, and it didn't help even a little bit.

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,560
I was extremely frustrated with this, and then later when I was assigning more angry

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:54,480
dwarves to a different squad, I realized that I had set up a torture squad.
