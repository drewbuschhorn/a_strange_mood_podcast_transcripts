1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
I mean, that's kind of it.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,960
Like you could say the era has ended,

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,840
but you can keep playing the Dwarf Fortress game forever.

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,760
It's just, there'll be fewer and fewer

5
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,680
interesting things happening until you get bored and leave.

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,520
It's kind of a metaphor for life.

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:30,520
Oh no, let's hope not.
