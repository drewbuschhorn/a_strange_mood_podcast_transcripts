1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
The door banged shut behind him and Cole smiled to herself as she scraped the blade over her

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,960
scalp once more.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,400
The news of Vabok's death, rather the news of his ghostly apparition wafting into the

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,680
tavern near the caverns, took time to reach Cole, who was sleeping peacefully in her engraved

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,640
bedroom, dreaming of the newly engraved temple.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,440
When she woke, she stretched, smiling to herself, warm in the belief that life and rag dreams

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,800
had turned a corner.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,820
She stopped in the temple on her way to the tavern, a brief moment to herself to thank

9
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,720
the gods for her blessings.

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,960
Sure the zombie preying beside her smelled a bit bad and the manager had yelled at her

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,240
again on her way here, but she had a plan to order some better meals from the kitchen

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,320
and there were enough yaks to slaughter one for meat and tallow.

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,000
Soap at last.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And best of all, she had Vabok with his warm smile and his really great axe.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,720
The good mood carried Cole through the rest of her day, even though lunch was mussel pancakes,

16
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,120
again, and she even felt up to the task when the first reports of the ghost reached her.

17
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,560
Ghosts were nothing new, after all.

18
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,960
After the Weremonitor lizard attacks, most of their resources had gone to entombing the

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,160
remains they could identify and engraving slabs to honor those they could not bury.

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:26,320
More than one ghost had spurred them to speed the Enterprise.
