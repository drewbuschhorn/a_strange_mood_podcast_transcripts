1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Regardless, it started with shared laughter over the manager's complaints to Cole, overheard

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,360
by Vavok one evening in the dining room.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,260
The manager was always complaining.

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,120
Nothing pleased him, possibly because he'd inherited the job after his predecessor died

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,480
in the great zombie attack of 110, and he had no idea what he was doing.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,680
As its complaints echoed off the unsmoothed walls, Cole felt the familiar exasperation

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,600
sinking in, the despair that somehow everything was always her fault.

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,280
But Vavok met her eyes and smiled comfortingly.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,320
Gravity shifted.

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,360
The inexorable pull of the minds eased, and she felt the knot of volcanic fear and stress

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,880
ease, seeing for the first time the calm warmth of his sepia-toned eyes.

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,160
Stolen moments turned into a lingering ittle.

13
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,680
They act as though I can stitch the zombies back together, Cole ranted to Vavok one peaceful

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,640
night over plump helmet beer.

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,280
The same old boos and other sorts of dorvant angst that Cole had to hear about, as if she

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,320
could control even the crops.

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,320
What do they want me to do?

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,320
I'm helping carry the bodies?

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,560
I helped mine out the tombs for the truly dead?

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,600
I even sorted through that pile of teeth to get the right bits into the right coffin.

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,760
They act like I just sit in the depot all day, gossiping with merchants.

22
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,760
What more can I do?

23
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,120
Vavok leaned over and kissed her smooth scalp.

24
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,960
They know you can't fix it, he said.

25
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,040
They don't expect you to fix it, but they trust you with their fears.

26
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,120
Cole took a long pull of her beer.

27
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,280
She could taste the grit of the rock mug through the rough sourness of the mushrooms.

28
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,800
Maybe the dwarves' complaint about the boos was fair.

29
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,440
Maybe she understood.

30
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,920
The words settled into her buried bones.

31
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,880
She found a core of empathy she never knew existed, and listening to the haranguing voices

32
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:56,360
became a gift she could offer to her fellow settlers.
