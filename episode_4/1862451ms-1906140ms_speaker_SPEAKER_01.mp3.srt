I liked the article talking about the new programmer they hired, where one of the first

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,400
things they started being defensive about in the article was about pathfinding.

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,160
Because in this version of Dwarf Fortress, we talked about it before, I think, in our

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,080
first episode, in the older versions you used to be able to mark doors as pet forbidden.

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,520
And they took that out of this version, supposedly to improve the pathfinding, so it doesn't

spend so much time trying to calculate where the pets go.

But it still seems to be that you have a lot of kittens, things start slowing down massively,

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,840
and so I'm left wondering, like, pathfinding?

00:00:42,840 --> 00:01:01,160
What even is it?
