1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
It's a really great axe," he said.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,160
I just—I really like it.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,020
He gazed fondly at the axe.

4
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,320
As far as Cole could see, it was nothing special.

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,720
A battle axe with an avocado-wood handle and a copper blade.

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,560
She had bought it herself from the merchants the previous fall, intending it for their

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,160
newly formed squad.

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,000
But she was very empathetic, and anything Vabok-like she liked, too.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,780
That's—well, that's great, dear," she said meekly.

10
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,780
He beamed at her.

11
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,080
I think I'll take it with me today.

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,800
We're digging out that ramp to the water in the second cavern so that the new hospital

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,800
can have a well.

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,080
Perfect, Cole said, her enthusiasm genuine this time.

15
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,520
The hospital was her idea, and if any miner could get that ramp done, it was Vabok.

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,960
And if having this axe with him helped him feel good about the job, all the better for

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:01:00,960
everyone.
