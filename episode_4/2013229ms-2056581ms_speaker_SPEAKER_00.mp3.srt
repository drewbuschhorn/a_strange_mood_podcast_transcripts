1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
The pinkish rock salt tablet seemed woefully inadequate to the bearded man that had changed

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,640
Cole Copperlepper's world.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,780
They hadn't noticed each other at first.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,960
On the long cold journey to the New Fort in the lean early years of Ragdreams, when all

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,920
had been dolomite dust and cold berry mush for dinner, he had simply been another dwarf

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,080
in the mix.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,920
He was an adequate miner, a decent conversationalist, but not really noteworthy in any respect.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,800
Unlike many of the others, however, he didn't yell at Cole.

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,000
Somehow he had recognized that being expedition leader did not truly make her the arbiter

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,240
of the Fort's fate.

11
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,600
It might have been his politeness that made her appreciate him at first, or maybe his

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,560
pleasant tenor singing voice.

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,040
Or maybe it was just his complete and cheerful disinterest in what anyone else thought of

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:01:00,560
him.
