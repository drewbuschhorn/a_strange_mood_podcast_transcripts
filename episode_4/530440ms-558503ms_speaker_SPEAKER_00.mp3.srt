1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
Things not going great on that front.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,680
And I sent them out on a mission.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,260
We'll come back to that though,

4
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,560
because I have other things to talk about

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,360
because so much has just been going so poorly.

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,240
I also did meals and I found them some mist in a place

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,820
and got my hospital set up finally, because we got a well.

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,520
The well was a tragedy that you all will hear about

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,600
later in the episode when I read to you

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,600
a little story that I wrote about it.
