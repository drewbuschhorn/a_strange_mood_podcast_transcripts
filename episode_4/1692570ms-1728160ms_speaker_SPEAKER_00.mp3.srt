Okay, so I begin to despair of ever getting beyond town, but then I remind myself that I

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,520
am still learning. Like, I thought I was doing pretty okay, and then I realized that I didn't

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:18,080
have my taverns correctly, or they... I didn't have my taverns meeting the tavern criteria,

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,120
so that explains why, you know, maybe those weren't as successful as they could have been,

00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,160
and only just got a hospital. We planned for me to get started on magma, but then things just

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,080
kind of went crazy, so I still have a really long way to go with this fort, if we can hold on.

00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,080
Yeah. I don't...
