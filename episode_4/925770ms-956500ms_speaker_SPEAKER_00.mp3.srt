00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
Yeah. So I went through the dwarves' knowledge and just looked at random musical forms that

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,480
they knew and found an instrument that two of them was listed in two of the musical forms and

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,600
assumed they'll probably know how to play it. I found two that were overlapped and the other

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,920
instrument I couldn't find the pieces at any of my workshops. So I was like, well, I guess not that

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,000
one. Could be Elvish for all you know. Yeah. So that's what's happening there. I'll probably play

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,640
some more tonight and by the time we record next week.
