1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,880
They mined deeper, as dwarves will.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,360
They began to smooth and engrave their walls and floors in an attempt to create peace and

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,680
beauty in their dirty and blood-smeared world.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,640
There was talk of starting a hospital to treat the numerous injuries from the were and zombie

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,920
invasions.

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,120
No one felt happier, not really, but Cole felt as if she was helping, finally, and that

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,520
made the entire world feel lighter.

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,960
All because of Babock's warm, gentle presence in her life.

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,160
Cole felt herself becoming lighter, too.

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,600
Months passed, and uneasy peace settled over their hamlet like a fine mist.

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,320
Things occasionally took a turn for the strange, admittedly.

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,520
Zombie janitors carted away waste, children played make-believe in the numerous tombs,

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,520
peasants, unable to find their calling, created extraordinary artifacts.

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,960
And Babock found a battle axe he liked.

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,920
He came into the bedroom that morning as Cole shaved her scalp, a daily routine made worse

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,000
by the lack of soap and a mirror, but it was what she did and had done for years, and it

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,100
made her feel like herself.

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,800
He wrapped one arm around her waist, the axe in his other hand, and kissed her on the neck.

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,000
Look at this axe, he said.
