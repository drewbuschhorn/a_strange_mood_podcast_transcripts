1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
That's correct.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Yeah.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,280
And frequently, you know, like the stone, wood, and food, you get that knocked out real

5
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,280
quick.

6
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,280
Yeah.

7
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,160
But then when it comes to, say, needing 35 gems, gem orders completed, that one can be

8
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,160
more of a challenge.

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:34,160
Yeah.
