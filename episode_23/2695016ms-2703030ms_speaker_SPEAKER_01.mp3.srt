1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
Yeah.

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,700
Easy enough to take care of.

3
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,220
Yeah.

4
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,220
Just I think the way the random number generator works right now

5
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,180
just favors goblins a bit, I think.
