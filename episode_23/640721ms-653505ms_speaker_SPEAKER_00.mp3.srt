00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
And then the same with the animal fiber.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,320
You have to have the farmer shear the animals

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,140
and then spin it into yarn,

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,720
and then the weaver makes the yarn into cloth.
