Oh, well see that's good. They say in The Sims that you're like second generation of

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,880
Sims is going to be better at everything they do because they have actual Sims teaching

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:16,160
them things. Now, children's, children in The Sims are the reason I don't play The Sims,

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,200
what are we on three, four? Four. Yeah, I don't play The Sims 4 anymore because children

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,440
are just so incredibly janky and needy and they just made them more complicated so I'm

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:31,680
never touching that again. But yeah, so the dwarven children who are going into guild

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,160
halls and learning presumably are going to be smarter and better at stuff than their

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:55,160
parents.
