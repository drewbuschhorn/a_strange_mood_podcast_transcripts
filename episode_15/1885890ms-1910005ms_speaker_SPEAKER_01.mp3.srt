Yeah, and like one example is that stockpiles, if you select all, it will automatically have

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,760

00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,280
it did a forced pause to tell me that a stray alpaca was starving, and it had come with migrants

00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:30,480
and I just hadn't gotten it assigned to the cave pasturian. So I was able to save that alpaca.
