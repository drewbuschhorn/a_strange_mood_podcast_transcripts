1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
Yeah, so it's pretty easy.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,760
I don't think that it was a calm or peaceful

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,060
or whatever location.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,420
Like I expected to have wildlife

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,940
and we really, really haven't.

6
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,780
Not even, not outdoors or in the caves.

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,080
So it's seemed to be a peaceful location

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,380
and I might end up regret, end up regretting choosing it.

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,380
But the nice thing about it so far,

10
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,340
even though I haven't found a lot of metals yet,

11
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,740
we have a lot of the really beautiful, colorful stones.

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,620
So we've got a ton of jet.

13
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,600
So that looks really cool in combination

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,900
with like marble and microclime.

15
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,420
And I have like a really neat bedroom setup

16
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,300
with like four long spokes off a staircase

17
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,260
and the rooms are kind of staggered off of it.

18
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,780
And they're all in those colors

19
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,180
and just without really any work from me,

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:01:00,180
it looks pretty cool.
