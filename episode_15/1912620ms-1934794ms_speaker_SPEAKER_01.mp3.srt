1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
with this one.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,840
Yeah, I've gotten to the first and second layer of caves,

3
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:07,840
but back to with the DF hack thing in the hive box,

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,520
I noticed when I looked at the hive

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,240
that it said it would need jugs.

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,600
And I was like, is this Dwarf Fortress or is this DF hack?

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,320
I don't know, but I guess I better go make some jugs.

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,640
So hopefully we'll have some honey.

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,240
Do they make mead with that?

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,080
What happens?

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,080
Thank you.
