Well, Fiery City has had a couple of interesting things occur over the course of the last,

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:12,160
about, I think I've played two years worth of it. The first thing is that we've established a

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,800
new tavern. I'm calling it a wet tavern because it has the mist generator that I designed,

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,760
falling down the center of it and splashing out and creating a one level of water deep thing

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:33,040
throughout the entire floor.
