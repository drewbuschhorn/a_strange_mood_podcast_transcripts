1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Yeah, you know, after I had a couple weeks off from the game, just kind of taking a break from that,

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,000
because it's good to not burn out on, you know, even fun things. I went back to Bellblade,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,520
I booted it up, I was looking around. I couldn't remember. Like, there was this guild hall that I

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,720
was building, and I couldn't remember who it was for, and there was just a lot going on, but nothing

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,640
really was happening, and it was all very defensible, and I was just like, you know, I feel kind of done

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,880
with this one. Like, it's doing really well, it's a metropolis. And then there was another migrant

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:40,160
wave that was pushing the population up over 170. And I was, like, thinking about how much work it

8
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,920
was going to be to get the bedrooms and everything and furnished for all that, and I was just like,

9
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,800
yeah, it's time. I just retired it. And, you know, I might check back in on them, kind of like I did

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,320
with Curlkey, but I don't feel too remorseful. I was kind of attached to a few individuals there,

11
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,400
but also, like, they don't really exist. So I wasn't that sad.
