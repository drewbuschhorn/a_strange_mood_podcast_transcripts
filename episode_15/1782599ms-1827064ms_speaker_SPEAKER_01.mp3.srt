1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
Yes, so we're an interesting people.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,720
Apparently we like wet things.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,080
But it's, so for other city facilities,

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,320
we're still in like our first 18 months, I would say.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,200
Just got a tavern up and running.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,080
It's not very exciting.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,000
I put in like a marble floor.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,720
I only have a few tables so far,

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,760
again, with the various colors.

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,560
And we only have 17 dwarves,

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,080
so it's not like things are really booming anyway.

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,800
The temple I just started and it's really pretty rough,

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,000
but I didn't want anyone to end up with the prayer deficit

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,240
where they have to go and pray

15
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,840
for three months or whatever.

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:56,840
And let's see, let's see.
