1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,480
Yeah, and a different dwarf replaced her as the bookkeeper. So I had wondered, like I saw that

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,240
she stopped being bookkeeper and I was like, what on earth did they do? Well, they made her champion.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,200
And browsing through Legends mode even more, it looks like she was a resident of my fort's tomb

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,040
dens, rasp boat, and Krolky at the very least. Like those are the ones that I like remembered

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,800
and stuck out to me. So she, I guess, has migrated around in her life and then came out to this far

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,000
continent. And now I'm wondering, it's a different civilization, but she has changed civilizations

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,880
before if she will come to Wet Ring. So I am I'm going to be on the lookout for her.

8
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,920
She is married and has two children. And her husband's goal was to start a family.

9
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,320
Oh, hers was to master a skill. So hopefully she can do that as fort champion.

10
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,040
But her husband, Bim Frosty Fountains, is quite a martial leader. Yes, I love that name,

11
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:07,200
Bim Frosty Fountains. But he's led several attacks for the Razor of Socketing, which is

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,240
that other civilization that I forgot to start my new fort in for continuity. But he lost all of

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,400
those attacks except one, I think. So it's a good thing that like his goal is not to be a successful

14
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,360
military leader and is instead to have a family because now they have two children. They seem happy.
