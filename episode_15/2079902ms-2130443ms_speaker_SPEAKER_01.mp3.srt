00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yeah, I don't know. I definitely still need to get to magma.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We have, part of why I picked this location is because of the variety of stone.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We have multiple colors of sand, which you told me and I was disappointed just all lead to green glass.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Alas, because black glass would have been really cool. Oh well.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
At any rate, got lots of sand. I think I have clay too, so I can have all kinds of industries at this new fort.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I guess I'll try to compensate for the lack of violent action by starting various industries.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And I did, I finally put in a dye workshop for the first time because we were getting our cloth industry started

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and I'm trying to stay ahead of the need for clothes.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And I was like, oh, I'll dye them. And then I was like, wait, I don't have, nevermind.
