00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
that did not actually kill them because then they got through and played round robin around

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:13,560
the staircase going up from that level with a guard dog for something like two days as

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,800
other dwarves walked by.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,180
Oh my gosh.

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,440
That blind cave ogre was a little bit of a character.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,740
He has an amazing memory, a lot of willpower, but he has an iffy sense for music.

00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,480

He does not have a great aesthetic sensitivity and he considers ideas and abstractions over

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:01:02,560
practical applications.
