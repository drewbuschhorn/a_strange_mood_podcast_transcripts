1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
And it just kept trying.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,320
Oh, poor little kid.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,200
Because I think there's some sort of math

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,120
about when you're hauling, like your weight versus the weight

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,680
you're trying to haul, and then the risk of slippage

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,640
when you're doing that.

7
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,800
And so it just kept slipping again and again.

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,560
And they were getting thirsty and all this sort of stuff.

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,060
So.

10
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,600
It's pretty funny.
