1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
Exactly, and people do spend a lot of time in there,

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,580
and they don't ever seem to get a negative moodlet

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:05,380
from the wet feet.

4
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,580
That's because of the alcohol.

5
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,300
Exactly, but they are getting positive moodlets

6
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,860
from the mist that's falling down in a couple of places

7
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:31,220
through it.
