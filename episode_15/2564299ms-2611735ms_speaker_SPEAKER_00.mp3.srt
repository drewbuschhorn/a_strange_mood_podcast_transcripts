00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,960
I also tried to look up the backstory behind the Seelicanth god, who had created I think

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,600
three or four different necromancers.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,920
I couldn't find too many more details about the Seelicanth god himself.

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:23,120
He doesn't have any temples or he doesn't have any groups or societies.

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:29,840
But he doesn't seem to be great luck for his necromantic followers either, though.

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:39,440
Two of them died rather quickly after becoming necromancers using the tablets he created.

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:47,160
One seems like kind of a fun person because she's been married and divorced eight times.
