00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
Oh, okay, gross. At any rate, I'm going to have to look up, what is beekeeping called?

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,120
Apiary?

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,240
Apiary, yeah.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,400
Anyway, yes, got to look up apiary in the wiki. So maybe next time I can report back about my

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:22,000
adventures in Dwarven Honey. But the biggest problem that I've had actually so far is related

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,080
to the caverns in that I have been really diligent with my last few fort ventures about walling off

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,760
where we're living in the caverns so that we don't get all the cave people invading constantly.

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:42,560
The caverns at this fort are really like craggy and hilly, so the terrain is just

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,600
spanning multi-levels. And it's going to be really, really hard to wall in, I think, because

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,440
those walls will have to extend like this.
