There are also some other ways that it's been done in the past with the older version.

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Like, um, I think Krug Smash made a, an entire little coliseum at one point.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,500
Uh, like built it with dwarves and then instantiated using, you know, hacking the, the save file.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,000
Uh, instantiated the different creatures and all of that.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Whoa, that's crazy.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,500
I think he instantiated them into, uh, cages and then released them to fight each other.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,000
Something like that.
