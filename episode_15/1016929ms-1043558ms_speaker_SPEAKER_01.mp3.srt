00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,660
I've been having some fishing problems at, uh, I had some at Bellblade and we talked

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:10,260
about it a little bit, that maybe I was just telling them to capture live fish, not like

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,720
catch them for eating.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:19,680
And I have, I've set up a fishery in like the cave lake and nothing's happening.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,260
Like no one's doing anything.

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,560
And I have fishing enabled and people assigned, so something I'm going to have to think about

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,560
again.

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,560
Fishing.

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,560
Fishing.
