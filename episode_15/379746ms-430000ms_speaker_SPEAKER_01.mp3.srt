1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
this in 10 seconds.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,920
Oh, well we have talked about Legends Mode before, but Legends Mode is when you export

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,960
your world save and you can look at all the people and the history of cities and civilizations

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,960
and things.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,200
It's very fun.

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:20,160
So I looked up the history and goings on of Bellblade and as I was saying, none of my

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,080
beloved characters had really done anything interesting like Rith Guildthunders, that

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,400
unhappy child whose parents died in a demon attack.

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,560
There's no additional information about her, so I'm assuming she's just still wandering

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,360
around despondently.

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,120
Whatever.

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:46,040
But I did notice that there had been a change in leadership a little bit and in the late

13
00:00:46,040 --> 00:01:03,080
autumn of 134, I believe I left in like summer of 134.
