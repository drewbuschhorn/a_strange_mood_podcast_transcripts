1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
from the dimple cups.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
From the dimple cups.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Yeah.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,440
And then I bought some seeds from our merchants that I think must need to be grown outside.

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,120
I don't remember what they were.

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,520
Because I couldn't get, I know we have them, but I couldn't get the option to plant them

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,720
in the caves where all of my farms are.

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:32,000
So I'll explore that and report back.
