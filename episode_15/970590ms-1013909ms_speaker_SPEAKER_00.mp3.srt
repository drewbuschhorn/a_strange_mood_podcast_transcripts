1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
And then, yeah, so that was our, those were our vermin waves.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,640
Meanwhile, plans to turn this into an aquarium fort are proceeding apace.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,280
Oh, good.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,720
We've got a, we've gotten down to lava. We've got a good glass industry going.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:23,200
I think last county had something like 45 glass terrariums or aquariums.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:23,700
Yeah.

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:30,580
And so I'm going to start having people work on catching the various saltwater creatures around,

8
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,100
including sea nettles.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,220
Oh, cute.

10
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,540
Yeah, exactly. I want to, I want to catch some of those sea nettles.

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,620
But unfortunately, and I'll talk about this again a little bit later,

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:53,060
our best fisher dwarf is dead.
