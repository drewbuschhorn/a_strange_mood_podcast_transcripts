At any rate, it's pretty cool, but I think that the entry period only goes through tomorrow,

00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,920

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,640
is July 4th. I guess happy 4th of July. July, yeah.

00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,200
If you do that. Anyway, so if you want to enter one of your monsters,
