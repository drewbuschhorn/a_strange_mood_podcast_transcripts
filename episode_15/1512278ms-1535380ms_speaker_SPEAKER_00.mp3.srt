00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
Yeah, the other fun part of managing children that I recall

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,440
is that you can assign them to individual rooms,

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,000
but you don't have to.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,600
And it's very confusing to me.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,440
I always get very confused in Dwarf Fortress

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,520
when there are things that you can do,

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,120
but don't have to do to accomplish something.

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:23,720
It's the same thing with that you can assign either a room
