00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
Yeah, best I can tell, Rakost is still out there being an enemy of our civilization,

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,640
and possibly still living in a ruined fort called Anvilflux, where heroes keep trying

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,480
and failing to kill him.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,760
So perhaps I will go there in adventure mode.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:22,959
I'm so curious though about whether he's still there, and I love this that he was king until

6
00:00:22,959 --> 00:00:26,480
he was killed by the Forgotten Beasts that wrecked the town.
