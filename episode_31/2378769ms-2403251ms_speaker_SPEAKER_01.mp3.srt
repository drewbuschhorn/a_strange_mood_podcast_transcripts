00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Oh yeah, well she was sad about the one that she sold because she feels that she betrayed him, which I mean, she kind of did, I guess.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And then I was like, okay, I don't want her to be sad about selling the animals, so I'm going to make her husband sell the animals.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And then she was sad about that and feels betrayed and sometimes she's mad at her husband now too.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And I would be, like, if you sold any of my animals, I would be quite angry.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I would sell you.
