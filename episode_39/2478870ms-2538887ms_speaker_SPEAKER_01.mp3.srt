I have found it really interesting, as I've gotten over the years more into Dwarf Fortress,

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,320
just the procedural generation aspect. And actually, I meant to tell you in the Discord

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:21,440
that Tarn has edited a couple of books of sort of essay paper type things, one of which is

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:27,360
procedural generation of music. So I'm going to grab some of that and I'll send it your way to

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:35,599
give you homework. I apparently assign people homework. But man, it's just amazing that they've

6
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:41,599
made this and worked so hard to not make a commercial. I know I harp on this kind of every

7
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:46,959
episode, but part of what I love about Dwarf Fortress, even when I'm not playing it a lot,

8
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:56,000
is the outsider art aspect of it. That it's just this weird artifact that we call a game because

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,759
it's distributed like a video game, but it's this weird.
