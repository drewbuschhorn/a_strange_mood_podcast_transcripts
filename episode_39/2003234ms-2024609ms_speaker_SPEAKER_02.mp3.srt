1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,320
Well, let's be clear.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:05,040
So some, some of them, some of the stuff in there is just nuts.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,860
Like, I'm, I'm sorry, I'm not going to divide a perfect fourth

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,280
into 11 different notes.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,400
It's that is going to sound like nothing.

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,560
It's going to sound like nothing.

7
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,120
So I am, I am being pretty selective, but I'm always, always

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,600
searching for songs in Dwarf Fortress.

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,240
It's, it's an amazing part of, of the game.
