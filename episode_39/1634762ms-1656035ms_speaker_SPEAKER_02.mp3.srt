1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
uh, gloss over how much walking they do.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,240
Half, half the book is just going from one place to another and just talking

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:08,680
about that.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,040
It's, it's, it's wonderful.

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,200
I really appreciate that.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,520
It really actually pulls you into the world.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,700
Um, so yeah, in my near future, there's going to be a pocket world and an

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,160
adventurer that can really like explore all of it.

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,280
And I want to see if I can.
