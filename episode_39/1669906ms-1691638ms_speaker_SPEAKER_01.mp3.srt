One thing I wanted to talk to you about and hear your process behind is, you made some

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:12,160
dwarven music based off the procedurally generated stuff within one of your worlds.

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,360
Can you kind of talk about how you try to interpret that and take that and turn it

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,600
into something real? Because the stuff you've made is really interesting sounding.
