00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
So, actually, interestingly enough, I've been going back to version 47 the last two weeks,

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,640
just on a nostalgia kick.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,240
It's just the time of year.

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,440
That's kind of how my brain works.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,120
I do things in cycles.
