1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
And if something occurs to me, I just do it.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,520
And this is creative advice that I give

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,880
to anyone who's asking.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,700
I'm a music teacher by trade, I should say that.

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,640
That's what I do.

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,720
Catherine and I started our own studio here,

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,520
East Mountain Studios, again, back in the pandemic.

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,200
And that's our full-time job now, so.
