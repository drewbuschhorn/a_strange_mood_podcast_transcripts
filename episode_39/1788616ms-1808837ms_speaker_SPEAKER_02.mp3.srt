1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
They'll describe it explicitly, and you just have to count up the number of quarter tones.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,380
So you write that down, and then they tell you the very specific scale of the song.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,320
You kind of have the master collection of notes that they tell you, and then they tell

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,320
you the scale.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,480
So like, this is the onom heptatonic scale, and it's the first, the third, the fifth,

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,000
the seventh, the ninth.
