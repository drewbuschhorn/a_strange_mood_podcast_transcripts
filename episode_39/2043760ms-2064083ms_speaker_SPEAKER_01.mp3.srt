I've been impressed that the most recent version of OpenAI can actually finally follow the

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,940
instructions from there and create something that at least seems to me on first glance

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,520
to actually be following the instructions.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,520
Is it good?

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,520
No.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,200
But it's following the instructions, which when someone's telling you to do, you know.
