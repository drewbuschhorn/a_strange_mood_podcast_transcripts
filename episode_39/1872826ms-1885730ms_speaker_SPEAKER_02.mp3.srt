1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
where someone mentioned physical modeling synthesizers,

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,200
which I had not heard of.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,580
So I went down the rabbit hole

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,680
of looking into physical modeling synthesis.

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,400
And what that is, is a software instrument

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,400
that you trigger with a MIDI controller.
