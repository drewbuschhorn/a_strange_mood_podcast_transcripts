Yeah. Um, and you had warned me about that. So I was, I was careful there. And although I was

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,280
obviously surprised that the Duke was just gone, but I did see some interesting differences. They

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:19,280
had appointed a bunch of, um, nobles that I didn't. So there was like a hammer dwarf and a champion

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,800
and all of like the, the justice system seemed to be in place without any input from me,

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,120
which I thought was really, really interesting. Although they hadn't like built a dungeon or

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,720
anything like that. So I don't know how effective this dwarf implemented justice system was,

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,760
but it existed.
