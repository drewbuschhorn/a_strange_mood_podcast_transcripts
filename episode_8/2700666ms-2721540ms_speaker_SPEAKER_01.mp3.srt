1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
I think that's my conclusion.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,920
Some people can probably do it,

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,140
but I think a little bit of preventative happiness

4
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,400
is a good thing.

5
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,960
Oh yeah, that's the other thing I was gonna say

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,960
is that with this fort, with how shallow that aquifer is,

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,400
I think that I will be able to do the windmill thing

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,160
and start trying to pump of some sort.

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,240
I think that's a great idea.

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:30,240
That's an experiment.
