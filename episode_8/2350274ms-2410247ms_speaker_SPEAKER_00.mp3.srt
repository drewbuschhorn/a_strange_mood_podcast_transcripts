00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,040
You had gotten actually a pretty good start to it, but the problem when dealing with water in Dwarf Fortress

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,320
is that you have to get everything absolutely right or it becomes

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,640
problematic quickly.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,160
And you had, I think, missed basically

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,760
four squares of smoothing that needed to happen.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,760
So I went and started the... I started kind of from the last point where you had gotten everything smoothed properly.

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,240
Mm-hmm. Then I went off in another direction. Mm-hmm.

8
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,760
For, you know, five tiles, whatever.

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,800
And then started digging down as well. Hit the aquifer again.

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,480
Yeah. And then set the smoothing on each level and what you kind of have to do is

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,840
dig out a hole, you know, dig a stair.

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:54,280
Then smooth around and not dig the next stair until that level is smoothed and then do it again and again and again until

13
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,600
they get through the aquifer. Usually ten levels. Okay. And... Wow. That's not fun.
