00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
See, there, I did some good Foley work.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,480
There you go.

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,880
I had fun with this one because it had a nice personality description.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,840
It has an utterly languid pace of easy living, calm and slow.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,440
It pursues matters with a single-minded focus, often overlooking other matters.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,680
It very easily falls in love and develops positive feelings.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,880
It finds helping others emotionally rewarding.

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,140
It tends to consider what others think of it.

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,360
It tends to share its own experiences and thoughts with others.

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,760
It doesn't often feel envious of others.

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,760
It rarely feels discouraged.

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,480
It has a tendency to consider ideas and abstractions over practical applications.
