00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
In the course of digging for hell, we accidentally breached a wall of lava.

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:06,620
Magma.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,200
Yeah.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,200
Something, whatever, whichever word you're supposed to use.

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:19,500
That poured out and killed several dwarves who were working there, resulting in a ghost floating around as the lava poured in.

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,600
I think that ghost was actually killed by the, by the blob of snow earlier.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,600
