1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
That sounds like something different.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,600
So yeah, that's what went on with KrullKey.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,800
I decided since I had a functioning fort and I could kind of ignore them for a while, that

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,320
I was going to experiment with the mist generator thing.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,680
So I made a lot of mistakes.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:27,520
I was doing this on stream and knew that I could channel out a place where the aquifer

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,520
was to create a perpetual pond.

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:40,320
I thought that I would pump the water up from there to a mist generator thing on grates,

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,720
with grates on another level and the dwarves could be happy because there's mist but not

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,560
puddles.

11
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:52,560
I'm not sure what I was thinking in that I didn't think there was enough water there

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,920
to pump so I had them turn it into a pond thing.
