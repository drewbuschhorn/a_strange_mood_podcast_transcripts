00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,940
But that Aquifer Man, like I know that this is like

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,280
such a newbie problem to be complaining about

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,680
and we've talked about it before,

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,680
but it's on multiple levels, it's constantly seeping,

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,400
I can't seem to dig around it,

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,400
and then I started like digging out a narrow walkway

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,080
with a channel on either side of it,

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,880
and then digging out under the next level

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,220
in those regions a little bit

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,600
so that I could have a deep pool for all this water

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,660
to go leaving a walkway kind of dry.
