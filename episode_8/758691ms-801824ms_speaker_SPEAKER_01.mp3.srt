00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Yeah. He, so maybe like nobody liked him at Curlkey, which was true. Nobody liked him

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,960
at Curlkey. And so he just went to start over somewhere. But apparently the Dwarves of Curlkey

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,720
were just, they were doing better than me. Still, I was interested in what might have happened,

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:23,200
like what changed. And then from the point of view of the player, seeing how things worked,

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,800
because there have been a lot of reports of people's nobles leaving. So like your manager

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,920
is gone or your bookkeeper or whatever, and you can't get work orders done or your broker is

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,880
gone. So you can't trade. Although I guess you can get another trader at any rate. I didn't run

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:55,920
into any of that. I, before I left, had made sure that none of my nobles were in a squad.
