00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So just for experimenting, I decided to un-retire Curlkey.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,940
Couple of years had passed,

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,360
and I discovered that Curlkey had become

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,680
the capital of their civilization.

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,200
Which I was very excited about,

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,520
and I started researching, like, what does that mean?

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,840
And I thought that it meant that the king lived there.

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,960
I couldn't find the king.

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,600
The duke was gone.

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,600
This is our master weaver duke who had been the mayor.
