00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,600
like two versions of Dwarf Fortress, let alone before this one. So yeah, I don't know if the

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,920
different in this version. Oh really? I don't really remember having like these huge waves

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,080
on waves that we've been having. It was usually more forgotten beasts that were that were the big

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,440
