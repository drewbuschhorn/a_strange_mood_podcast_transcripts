1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
It's just it's been so frustrating because I was dealing with it at that one fort that I just quickly abandoned because I gave up

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,460
And then now I'm dealing with it again

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:15,980
But this location seems so good that I'm not willing to to give up the part of the tropical location

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,940
Problem that I was having was the one I chose didn't have a lot

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:23,120
It was very very near the ocean because I wanted to try an ocean fort and see that

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,500
Particular flora fauna like the little sponge dudes or whatever

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,760
But we didn't have a lot of trees and it was just everything was wet

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,720
So I feel a little bit better about my current location in terms of still being a beginner

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:58,740
Because I feel like I'm going to be a beginner for the next 700 years
