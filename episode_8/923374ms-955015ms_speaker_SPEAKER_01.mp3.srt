00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Mm-hmm. Yeah, they were just everywhere

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,320
So that I mean that was an easy fix and like that's one way to organize your animals

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,000
Which I've been saying I needed to do because we had so many there were also just so so many yaks and water buffaloes

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So we had to do a mass slaughter

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,800
One kind of funny thing that I came across was that

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,640
Just some random dwarf had taken the chambers and everything that I meant for that

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,480
I built for the Duke so he was sleeping in the fancy bedchamber and presumably using that dining room and everything
