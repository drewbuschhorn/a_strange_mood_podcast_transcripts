00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,840
So I, I was just a little done with my fort in a good locale because they are kind of boring. Like

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,640
once the dwarves start like ticking along happily, unless someone goes crazy or something, like

00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,600
there's just not that much to say. And I didn't really feel all that moved to try to make Krull

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,600
Keep more aesthetically pleasing. I was just kind of, I was just done. So um, I retired it,

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:32,720
went to move on to a new location. I decided I, having done a good like woodland type locale,

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:38,800
I wanted to go somewhere tropical and see different flora and fauna. Um, dug into the

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:57,520
earth and there was an aquifer. That's fine. There was an aquifer at Krull Keep. I dug around it.
