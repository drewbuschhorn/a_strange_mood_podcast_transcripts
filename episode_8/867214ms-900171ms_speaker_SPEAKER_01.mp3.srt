Well, the wiki said he doesn't need a room, so I don't know.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,480
But I'm curious if you join our Facebook group,

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,120
you can tell me all about what a champion is and why.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,960
Also, from the gameplay perspective,

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,960
my work orders in zones didn't seem to persist.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,080
So I rolled up and they had no drinks.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,840
I guess it's not entirely true of the zones,

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,320
but the offices were broken because the bookkeeper didn't

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,160
have, it said he didn't have an office.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,200
But when I went to the zone that was his office,

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:59,040
it was his hind ear hind.
