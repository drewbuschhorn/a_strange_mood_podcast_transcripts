00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Management glitches, not so much.

00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:09,160
The bigger thing kind of in the past was actually that the fort was usually super chaotic compared to when I left it.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,160
Like they would have, um,

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,960
like,

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,400
floors would be half undone and

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,240
walls would be changed.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:29,280
Um, doors would be just left willy-nilly.
