00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,360
Oh my. So we had the Minotaur. We had a, also a Weregila monster, uh, that is a, oh, so I counted

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,480
that as a forgotten beast and that was just a Weremonster. Uh, this was a goblin actually,

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,480
under, underneath being a Weregila monster. Um, and I took a picture of its sprite because it

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,480
looks kind of stained glassy with its scales, like some of them are sort of black and blue,

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,200
and some of them are gold. And that was really cool. Um, he also died really quickly. I think

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,520
he got in a fight with a couple people and they fell into some water and died.
