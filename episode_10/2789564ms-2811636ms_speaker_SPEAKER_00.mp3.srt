00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
Yeah, because it's just the sort of accumulation, agglomeration type thing, because with the

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,040
zombies and the necromancers, you know, they can live forever, so they don't, so they just

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,840
keep building up. Yeah. And the same thing for the weres, that if the weres get over a critical mass,

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,400
then they start just changing everybody. I think vampires used to be a problem for that,

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:30,240
again, because they live forever. I have no idea.
