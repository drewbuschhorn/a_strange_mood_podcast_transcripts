1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
Oh, we are a barony now, yes, and I was not sure who to select to make baron, so I went

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,120
through and found someone who was happy and had a lot of friends and family in our fort,

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,920
and he was a leather worker, and I made him some nice chambers and a tomb, and he's very

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,920
happy.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,920
Excellent.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,920
Oh yeah, and that was another thing.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,920
I made a green glass coffin for the former mayor.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:29,400
I missed him, her, I think it was a her, not getting reelected, so she still has her office

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,920
and tomb, and the elf mayor, well, I made him an office.

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,920
It's not very nice.

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,600
Did you put a lot of work into it?
