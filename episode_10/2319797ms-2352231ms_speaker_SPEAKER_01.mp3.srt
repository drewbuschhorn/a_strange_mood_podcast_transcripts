1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Yeah, but we also wanted to talk a little bit just about kind of what we learned from each other while

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,000
doing this because it was it was an odd challenge taking over a fort that I hadn't built because

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,320
the way that you structure things and what is intuitive to you is not intuitive to me and um

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,400
just in terms of layout and we do a lot of the same work orders I think so at least that was

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,000
not too bad but um like you like your vertical bedrooms and that I'm still kind of slow at doing

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,560
that I was able to furnish them easily though because of the repeating work orders yeah no
