1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
So then I took those off and after a bit I realized, maybe about one season in, I realized

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,320
that I was running us into the ground in terms of food and drink.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,320
Oh dear.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,680
We're just running completely out.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:18,080
And I finally looked around and realized the reason for this was I had in the course of

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,780
redoing some stuff to use some of the doors and do all of that, I had messed up my manager's

7
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,780
office.

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,780
Oh.

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:30,480
The door was open and people were walking through it and I think apparently if he's

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,780
trying to work there and people walk through it, it interrupts him at his validating of

11
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,840
the work orders and so food and drink orders weren't getting sent out and all that.

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:47,720
So I fixed up his room and I also kind of forced everybody to start cooking and making

13
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:57,940
drinks and that started resolving it.
