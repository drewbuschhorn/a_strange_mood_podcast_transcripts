1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
Yeah. Uh, well you can still see that one because I trapped it in our caverns.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,060
Oh.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,840
It actually, uh, came up through the caverns into our area where we were farming and had all of our animals.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,760
It killed all of our animals.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,480
Alas.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,920
Yeah, uh, and then cut us off from our plump helmets. So that was bad for a little while.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,200
But it's still there, not causing problems. It's very cranky because of the miasma from all of the animals that it killed.

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,560
And its own dust. It's mad about its own dust.
