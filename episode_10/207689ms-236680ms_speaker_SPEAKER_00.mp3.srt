That's right! One of our listeners has built a nice little website where you can upload a copy of your fort

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and it will pull out a list of a bunch of the procedurally generated weirdnesses that come with creating a new Dwarf Fortress world

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
such as the various horrible rains that can occur and zombify people

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
or the musical instruments that are randomly generated throughout the thing

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and a couple of the other procedural monsters, stuff like that.
