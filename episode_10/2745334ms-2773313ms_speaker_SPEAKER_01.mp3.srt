Well, it's still brand new. I really like the layout and I'm working on... I'm gonna try to make it really defensible.

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,500
So I'm gonna line a hallway with traps and do that kind of stuff because I feel like my world is starting to skew just towards zombies.

00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:21,000
Like, it's all zombies. Every single fort I'm losing to zombies, which is a bummer.

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And I don't, like... I'm not ready to leave this world. I know I could generate a new world, but that one might tend towards zombies too.
