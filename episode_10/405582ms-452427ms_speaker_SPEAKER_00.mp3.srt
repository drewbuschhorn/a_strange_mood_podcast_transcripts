1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
Ah, but the upside to the grass being dead did give me a direction I decided to take the first year.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,140
Yes.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:13,440
And that immediately gave me a direction for what I needed to do, which was to get to a cavern as quickly as possible.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:13,940
Yes.

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,840
The reason for that being, our animals were going to starve if I didn't.

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,340
Right.

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:28,560
And so, yeah, year one was devoted, not entirely to digging down to the cavern, but it was devoted a lot of it to digging down to the cavern,

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,520
getting some, you know, the usual things to get the stuff up and running with a dwarf fortress going.

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,020
Mm-hmm.

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:40,540
Unfortunately, I had to kind of be an elf and make a lot of things out of wood to start with,

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:59,500
because we started in a very sandy, dirty, tree-loamy area.
