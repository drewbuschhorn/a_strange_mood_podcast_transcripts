1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Yeah, so that's a working theory. I don't really know.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,080
But my year was extremely exciting.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,000
So we had two goblin invasions,

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,340
so the one that I just mentioned,

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,920
and four forgotten beasts.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,920
Four?

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,220
Four. One of them was actually a Minotaur,

8
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,720
but I'm counting it as a forgotten beast

9
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,800
because it's just on the outside.

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,800
That one was really interesting

11
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,800
because it was killed by one dude who was a bowyer,

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,600
and he was just out fishing, and he killed that guy.

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,860
He killed Radiant Whispers the Minotaur.

14
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,440
He was just out fishing and ran into this thing

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,360
and straight up murdered it.

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,440
It was amazing.

17
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,240
So he was injured and got helped off to the hospital.

18
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,540
And unfortunately, I have kind of lost track of him.

19
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,240
If I had... Oh, no, he died.

20
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,820
But I do know he died.

21
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,920
Because we also got made a barony during that last year,

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,080
and I definitely would have made him baron,

23
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,040
but he did.

24
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,420
