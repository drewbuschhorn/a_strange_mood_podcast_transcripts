1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
And a monster slayer.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:01,780
Yeah.

3
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:03,380
So, he's an interesting guy.

4
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,220
I'm gonna try to follow him.

5
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,100
If we get back to Legends mode for this fort eventually,

6
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,540
I'm definitely starring him to find out what all went on in his life.

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,420
Yeah, good plan.

8
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,060
That was about kind of the highlights.

9
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,660
I guess the one other thing I want to mention is

10
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,500
a couple of artifacts.

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,700
Or, a couple of items. They're not artifacts, in fact.

12
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,500
One is a book called The World of the Author,

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,900
which is poorly written, apparently.

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,900
It's...
