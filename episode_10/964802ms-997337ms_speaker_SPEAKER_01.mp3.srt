1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Yeah. So we got to Magma and I started the workshops down there.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,240
But around the end of the year, I started to realize, like, I was looking at a

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,960
stockpile and I was like, wow, we have a lot of doors.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,400
Why do we have so many doors?

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,960
And I looked at the stocks and we had over 150 doors because you had sent a

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,320
repeating work order and it was just repeating.

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,160
Oopsie.

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,560
Oopsie. And we also ended up with a lot of shell helms for the same reason.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,800
So we've been the export center of shell helms and doors, except not the doors,

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:43,280
because doors are useful.
