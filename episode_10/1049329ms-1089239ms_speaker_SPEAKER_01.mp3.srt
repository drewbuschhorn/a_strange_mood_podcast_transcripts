00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
Um, you know, we had a couple and, um, they weren't like my first year, I was a little

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,600
concerned. I was like, this is not going to be an interesting enough thing to do on the

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:19,680
podcast. But, um, we also had a goblin monster slayer gaunt zombie. So this is a goblin monster

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,000
zombie who hunts other monsters, I guess.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That, uh?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,880
I don't know. Um, but she had heard the, um, that our tavern was a good place to hang out

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,520
and she, um, came and hung out.

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,520
Nice.

00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:52,520
Um, she's also a legendary wood burner and an adequate cook.
