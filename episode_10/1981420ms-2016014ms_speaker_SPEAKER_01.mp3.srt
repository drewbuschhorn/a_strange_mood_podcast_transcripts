1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
Why would they do that?

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,280
I don't know!

3
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,800
And it's not even one of the naked elves.

4
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,960
It's just an elf.

5
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,000
So I followed him as he was going down to Parley, and the diplomacy button appeared

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,040
and disappeared so quickly that I didn't have...

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,320
I didn't get a say in it.

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:22,280
And the elf mayor just started roaming around the map, presumably hopelessly, because he'd

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,040
failed in his duties, while the goblins then attacked.

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,640
And the dwarves took care of that pretty easily, but we did lose like eight people, I think.

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,640
And not all dwarves.

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,480
Some of them, again, were elves.

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,480
So...

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:55,100
Thank god you did that.
