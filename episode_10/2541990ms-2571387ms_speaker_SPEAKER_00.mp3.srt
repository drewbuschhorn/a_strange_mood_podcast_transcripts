Yeah, that's a problem with my setup in our fort here because I kind of rushed it a little bit and I didn't think it all the way through.

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:18,500
So there are a couple of places where the water as it kind of falls down to the section where then it'll make mist will pool up and cause dangerous terrain,

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:26,500
which is like level three, four, level three or four out of that, you know, one to seven thing that water does.

4
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,500
And that will cause them to drop their items.
