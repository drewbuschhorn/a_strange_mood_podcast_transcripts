1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,480
No, it wasn't really that bad.

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,960
So far, the big parts about it are

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,800
that we have a nearby necromancer tower that we'll

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,600
talk about a little later.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,400
And then also the unfortunate part

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,640
of this sort of evil haunted biome

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:33,080
is that all of the plant life around us is dead.
