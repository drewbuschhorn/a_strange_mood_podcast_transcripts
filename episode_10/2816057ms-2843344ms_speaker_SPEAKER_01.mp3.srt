1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,300
Oh, the other interesting thing that I did with my new fort is put it on a different continent.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,300
Oh, really?

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,300
Yeah.

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,940
I was really concerned that maybe we weren't going to get merchants, but it was in a location

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,180
where I felt like we could handle that.

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,180
But we do.

7
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,180
Nice.

8
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,260
So apparently your civilization's people will cross water to come and visit you.

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,620
Go get on a boat.

10
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,100
It's a savage location as well, so that'll be a fun challenge for me, because this is

11
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,260
my first non-neutral location.

12
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:33,720
Yeah.
