1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
But then he gave me some lessons and we got it going.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,720
But it was kind of flooding the outside.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,360
So I did, I put in some grates and it's,

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,800
you know, maybe one of us will do a YouTube stream

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,880
or a Twitch stream and put it on YouTube

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,640
and we'll do a tour of our shared fort.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,480
I think that's a good idea.

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,340
Yeah, so people can see that then.

9
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,080
And then I was having problems with it

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,480
just sort of flooding the outside

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,460
so I dug around a little bit

12
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,960
and eventually I just, I turned it off

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,560
because it was troublesome.

14
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,000
But then I decided to do what I can do pretty well,

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,320
which is to make attractive places for dwarves to hang out.

16
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,680
So I made us a really big tavern

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:55,480
that ended up being called the Gloved Syrups.
