00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:14,880
that we do differently was how we use space. In that I tend to cut out really, really big areas

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,200
to then see what resources I have on that floor. And then I'll build rooms inside of it. That's

00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,800
how I built the tavern was I carved out a giant room and then walled it and floored it and chose

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,440
what it was decorated with based on what kind of stone I had to make the walls and stuff.
