Yeah, you just, you really have to have some persistence and a little bit of luck to get through them.

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And so I was able to dig down for a while until we got through the aquifer, get to some good solid rock.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And then from there it was a pretty straight shot down to the caverns, opened them up.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Nothing too terribly exciting down there.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I hadn't actually yet run into any cavern dwellers actually in my two years that I've played.
