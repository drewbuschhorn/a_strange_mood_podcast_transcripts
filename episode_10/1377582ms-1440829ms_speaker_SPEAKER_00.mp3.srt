1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
Yeah, I think when I play my year again, I'm going to try to capture something from water

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,880
into the glass terrarium because it can hold water and then you can put water creatures in.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,280
Yeah.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,040
What I should do is go find that freaking thief, that freaking thief cave fish man,

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,080
fisherman, and lock him.

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,040
You mean our neighbor.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:29,280
Exactly. Lock him into a water terrarium, put him on display as an object lesson for anyone else

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,880
who would try to steal from us.

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,600
Nice.

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:37,440
The other fun thing was I turned the waterfall back on and we got some decent happiness from

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,200
that. I think that's draining good now.

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,360
Yeah.

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:48,320
But eventually it did freeze in the winter. And then the giantess Eda arrived, the contested,

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,280
and she came and killed a fisher dwarf. And I was a little worried because she was marked as tough.

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,840
But that fisher dwarf was then immediately raised by a human monster slayer necromancer.

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,240
Wow.

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:27,600
Like literally one turn after she died.
