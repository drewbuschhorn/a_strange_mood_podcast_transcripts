1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
But our squad took care of that really quickly.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,800
So it wasn't a big deal, but I took back over

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,920
and was absolutely overwhelmed at the industry

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,680
that was thriving from your leadership

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,540
and the number of work orders that you had going.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,600
Many of which I canceled because I was having

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,880
a really difficult time getting stuff done.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,040
And so you mentioned the office thing,

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,520
and I was wondering if the manager was tripped up

10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,860
because there were so many that were not able

11
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,800
to be fulfilled, like making soap and stuff

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,880
once we'd run out of the stuff that it couldn't repeat.

13
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,920
And so every month they're checking it and having to say no

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,600
and my gold altars that I wanted to make more temples

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:59,200
were not getting made.
