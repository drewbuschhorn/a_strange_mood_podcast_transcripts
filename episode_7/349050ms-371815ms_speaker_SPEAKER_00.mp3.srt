00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
So I'm gonna interrupt again because I've been doing something similar.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:09,920
See I'm derailing us already. I found that I was just scrolling down a whole bunch to put stairs in

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:16,640
to maybe get to hell and it got to one negative 129 and stopped and there was no more scrolling.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,000
I have not gotten the stairs built down there. So what do you mean by you're saying you're

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,560
having difficulty getting to hell? Are you just not finding it?
