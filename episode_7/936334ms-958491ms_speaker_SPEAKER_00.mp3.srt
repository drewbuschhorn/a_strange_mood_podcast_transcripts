1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
I think that happens.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,440
You know, it's handicrafts.

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:11,360
So that all happened, and I felt kind of bad for Irvod, and in my head was wondering about

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,660
dwarven elections and how those things go.

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:20,680
So I, when I got the opportunity to make, to choose a baron, I selected Irvod.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:30,680
So he failed up.
