1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
Then you'll have the Golden Age when less than 50% of civilized creatures are human

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:10,220
But there's no single majority so various civilized races people of the world

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:15,500
Yeah, then you have the Twilight Age which is where all of the non mundane creatures

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,740
So elves dwarves all of the goblins are all starting to die off

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:24,780
Yeah, and then the age of fairy tales where 90% of all civilized creatures are mundane read human

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,400
but some non mundane ones still remain and

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,940
And then you can get to the age of civilization the age of death the age of emptiness Wow

8
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,200
You can kind of figure out what all of those are I think without meeting you to read it
