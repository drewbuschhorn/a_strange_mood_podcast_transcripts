1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
And now he's nobility.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,360
And as I did this, I got to looking into them

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,520
because I was thinking about the whole election thing,

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,640
like I said.

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,640
And Orvod doesn't really have many friends.

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,360
Like one or two, he's not married,

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,300
he doesn't have any children, versus Carol,

8
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,880
who has two lovers, four children, and many, many friends.

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:29,440
So Carol definitely won that popularity contest.
