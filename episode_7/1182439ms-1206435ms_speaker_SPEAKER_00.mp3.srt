00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
I have absolutely no idea.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,920
This is something that I know that I need to work on, and I actually find the interface

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,760
on this really confusing.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,720
When you make a squad, it has the metal armor, leather armor, and no uniform.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,880
And they all have Xs by them.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:21,000
I cannot tell if clicking on one of them means no more, they're not going to do leather,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,560
or if that means they will wear leather armor.

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:30,560
I don't like leather.
