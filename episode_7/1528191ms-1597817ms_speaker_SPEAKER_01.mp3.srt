00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
Absolutely, okay, and this was actually a problem just to give some sort of context to Dwarf Fortress

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,640
this was actually a problem in other versions of Dwarf Fortress because

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,480
when you let that run for like 350 years if

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:18,700
They if there's a problem with the balancing of the powers of the different races like their abilities and that sort of thing

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:25,000
It's very easy for one race to come to just dominate repeatedly and for a while after necromancer

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,800
Necromancers were introduced all worlds would just tend to slide towards

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,460
Necromancy right and people would find that if they left it

8
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,300
You know running for more than 200 years or so it's zombies all the way down

9
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,260
It's zombies all the way down. Yeah, just no no recovering and that was kind of boring so

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It required some rebalancing, and I think it's a constant point of rebalancing amongst the Tarn and his brother

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,360
Yeah, so to go back to the ages okay

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,720
We have the age of myth the number of living powers and megabeasts is at least two-thirds of what it was when the world began

13
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,880
the age of legends

14
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:22,040
One-third of what it was when the world began the age of heroes the number of living powers and megabeasts is greater than three
