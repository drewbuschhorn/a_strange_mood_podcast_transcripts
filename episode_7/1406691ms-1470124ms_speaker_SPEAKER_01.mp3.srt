1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
No, you'll still see other forgotten beasts because you start out usually in the age of myth

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:11,720
Yeah, which means that of the forgotten beasts that were generated at worldstart at least two-thirds still exist

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,620
Yeah, when you go down from two-thirds to one-third of those

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,920
You then enter the age of legend

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,240
Yeah

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:28,040
And then if you drop down from the one-third down to no forgotten beasts you enter into the age of heroes

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,720
Okay

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,980
Then if you actually wipe out all the forgotten beasts in your entire world or someone does yeah

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,360
Then you begin to enter the ages of the great powers. Oh

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:48,960
so usually that means that you'll start out with the great powers like, you know, the Dwarven and Elven civilizations or

11
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,760
If you're getting down to a really low number of forgotten beasts, but you haven't gotten to zero

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,420
You might get something like the age of two powers when a great

13
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:03,540
Dwarven civilization existed and a great dragon existed. Oh, that's
