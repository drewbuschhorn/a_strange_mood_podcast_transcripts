1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And you'll know that you found the right place there in part also.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
There are two ways to get there.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
One is by digging through the strange volcanic wall.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That one's pretty tricky though because it can frequently go into the magma layer, directly into the magma layers.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And then the other way is by finding the glowing pit.
