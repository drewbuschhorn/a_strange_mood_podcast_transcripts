1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Yeah, it kind of depends on the material the monster is made of.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:03,700
Yeah.

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:10,200
I think I've said it in a previous podcast, exoskeleton things seem to be kind of crunched really easily.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:10,700
Mm-hmm.

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:18,700
Things that are made out of like lava or rock or gold or brass.

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,200
Brass colossi. Brass colossi.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:22,700
Mm-hmm.

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,200
I don't know actually if colossi is the right pluralization. Colossuses.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,200
You're asking the wrong person.

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:27,700
Yeah.

11
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,700
You're the Latin person.

12
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,700
Yeah, I know, but I think it must be a Greek word, I think.

13
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,700
I don't know.

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,200
Yeah.

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,200
At any rate, those are much more resilient and can frequently just wipe out, just tear through a fort.
