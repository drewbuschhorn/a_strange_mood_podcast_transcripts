It lets some time pass.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Yeah, it does seem that way.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
That's fair.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's funny that you can ask, like, what is the age of your fort?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And that can mean, like, what is the age of your fort?

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Like, how many years have you been at this settlement?

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What is the age of your world?
