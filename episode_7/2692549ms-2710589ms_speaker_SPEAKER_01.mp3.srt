00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
So I cleared it again and this time I had them put in a door, a hatch, on that stairwell.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,280
To contain the smoke?

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,920
Yeah, on the same level.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,760
And that seemed to fix the problem.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,320
So even though it was still generating smoke, it was keeping it on one level.

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:38,600
And so my personal like...
