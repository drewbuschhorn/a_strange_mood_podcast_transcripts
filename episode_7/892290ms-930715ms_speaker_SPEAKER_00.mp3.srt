Right. If you don't know about Crud Smash on YouTube, and I think he does maybe some

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,400
Twitch streaming as well, but he is a delight. Um, so yeah, found the amphibian men. They die

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,480
very easily and we've had a lot of fighting going on, but I think that we'll jump in where we talked

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,160
about last week. And first I have to make some corrections because I had talked about Carol the

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,640
being the mayor and being a legendary weaver. Carol is actually a legendary soap maker and the

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,960
mayor. And Urvad is the one who was the first mayor that then lost to Carol subsequently.

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,480
And that is a legendary weaver that I was saying was spending all their time.
