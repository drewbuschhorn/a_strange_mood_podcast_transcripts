Yeah, that's and that comes up to bring it back to CrackSmash. He does that and I always wonder like

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,840
is this a convenient fiction that he's telling us because he does he's a really good storyteller or

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,120
are these in fact always dwarves from other forts that then reappear? I don't think I could keep

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,080
track of my dwarves in that way especially because many of the names repeat so it would

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:30,640
be challenging. Absolutely, but yeah he does a good job with it.
