1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
They are created out of nothing.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,240
Yeah.

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,240
The dwarf fortress.

4
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,240
We don't have parents.

5
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,240
Yeah.

6
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,240
They just appear into the world.

7
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,240
Yeah.

8
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,240
But then after that, all of your dwarves that are born or the ones, those first seven from

9
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,960
your fortress, they become historical figures and actually exist in the game and will move

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,760
around the map even after you stop playing with them.

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:29,760
Yeah.
