1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Yeah, I feel like the amphibian men are dying a lot more easily than the Batman.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:10,500
And I noticed that the amphibian men use blowguns, which is funny, especially because I actually

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,600
had a dwarf make an artifact blowgun.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,760
Yeah, that's been pretty good.

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:22,120
And I also used the make a burrow in a safe zone and send all your dwarves that aren't

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:27,960
soldiers to the burrow to stay safe while the squad goes and takes care of business.

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,100
That worked really well.

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:34,720
My pro tip is don't forget that you assign your dwarves to the burrow or they will dehydrate

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,920
and slowly starve to death.

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,480
I didn't actually lose anyone to them, but I was just scrolling around going, why is

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,480
nobody getting anything done?

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,960
Why aren't they digging these tombs?

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,680
Why is everybody so hungry and thirsty?

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,480
Oh, okay.

15
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,760
And then I, in the moment, I think I was streaming.

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,000
So you can probably go to YouTube and watch all this go down.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,720
I just took down the burrow.

18
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,000
I need to reestablish it for further invasions.
