1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
Not in this version of Dwarf Fortress.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,680
In a previous version, I did go into the Age of Legends at one point.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,480
I think maybe that was also when I did a custom world generation

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,480
and set the number of Forgotten Beasts, Mega Beasts, I forget what the setting is in the old version,

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:30,480
down pretty low, so there was only like, I think I said like 20 or something.
