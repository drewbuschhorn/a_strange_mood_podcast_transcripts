00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
Well, I think that it might be time to start working on our scholarship.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,560
We don't have a library yet, and I'm eager to get one of those built.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:16,000
I definitely need to get the Count's quarters improved so that he's less grumpy about it.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,880
And I'm curious to see how, if the mayor keeps getting re-elected, which so far she is.

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,200
I think those are my big plans.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,200
I might want to try experimenting with water in a mist generator.

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,080
I think that I say that every time we record, but it is a little bit of a daunting project.
