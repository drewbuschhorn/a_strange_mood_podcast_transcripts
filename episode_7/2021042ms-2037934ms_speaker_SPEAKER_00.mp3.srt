1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,700
and I don't know what X or Y are.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,200
Exactly.

3
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,400
Right, and that's not very interesting to me.

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,800
But it was one of those things that I went to pull it up

5
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,560
and couldn't really tell what I was looking for or looking at.

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,060
And it's one of those, like, is this

7
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,260
how this is supposed to work?

8
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,520
Or am I doing it wrong?

9
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:30,360
Or is it just not what I expect?
