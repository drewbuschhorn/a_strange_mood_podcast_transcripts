Magic explanation is that there's some sort of calculation issue when smoke rises up from one level to another

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,080
or possibly in like the path again, maybe

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,760
Maybe the stairway

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,800
Smoking in there screws with the pathfinding again, and then that results in this but at any rate

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,920
If you ever run into FPS stuff like you just got to sit down and figure it out go look for something weird

00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:32,500
Yeah, or get DF hack installed relatively easy to install. Mm-hmm, and then run clear trash clear smoke clear kittens
