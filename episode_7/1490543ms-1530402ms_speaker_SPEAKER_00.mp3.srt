1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Well, we won't read directly off of it.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,720
I was gonna say, oh yeah.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,560
I was thinking about this a little bit because I, you know, being involved in this podcast,

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,280
knew what we were going to talk about.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,400
It's funny how that works.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,240
But I was thinking about how people will do different lengths of history at their world

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,400
gen.

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:27,200
And so I think that the tutorial and the sort of standard is 100 years of history, and most

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,600
of us start at year 101 or whatever with our settlements.

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,920
So does that mean if you let it run for 350 years or something, you might start in a different

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,920
age?

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,920
Absolutely.

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,920
Okay.
