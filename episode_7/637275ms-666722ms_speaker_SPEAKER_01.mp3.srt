1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
The second Forgotten Beast I'd like to talk about is Spen.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,400
The Forgotten Beast Spen has come.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,160
A giant three-eyed crab.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,100
It has a knobby shell and gaunt appearance.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,740
Its eyes glow yellow.

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,800
Its gray exoskeleton is rough and cracked.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,000
I kind of like that one.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,400
Again, it died pretty quick.

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,200
I said before that the exoskeleton ones really seem to die quickly.

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,400
The fun part about that one is, for once I decided before they actually got around to

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,240
killing it, to look at its traits.

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,000
Later.
