1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
And that's with a fair number of deaths, with all of the stuff that happened.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,360
Like I said, the webbing titan took out quite a few.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:16,080
And we are still getting migrants despite the danger, which I enjoy reading.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:22,200
And in dealing with that, I'm still playing catch up, trying to keep up on the drinks.

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,220
That has been a struggle for me at this point, and it's something I'm working on.

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:32,520
Because I think I realized that they had permission to cook with wine and some things.

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,800
And every time traders would come, I would be sure to buy whatever alcohol they had,

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,440
and we'd just burn through it.

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,880
And then I was like, I need to go and check that.

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,200
And sure enough, they were making fine meals with wine.

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,800
So now that we are not cooking with alcohol, we are only drinking with alcohol.

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,800
Hooray!
