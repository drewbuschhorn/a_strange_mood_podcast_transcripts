00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
So that's one need that I've been struggling to keep up with a little bit.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,760
Hopefully it'll be better now.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:11,400
I've also had some of the clothing problem, which is why we had our little skit about

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,200
dwarves taking off their clothes.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,960
And apparently this is an ongoing problem to the point that there are jokes about it

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,960
in the wiki.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,100
And the dwarves will indeed take off their clothes when they are worn out and then go

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,000
naked to get new ones.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,840
If new ones exist.

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,840
If new ones exist.

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,640
Otherwise they'll just be naked and angry.

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,760
And they also don't really throw old clothes away.

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,960
So you have to kind of make that happen and there are ways via the atom smasher.

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,280
And I have not started to run into the problem of being completely overrun with trash, which

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,240
I think that with this many dwarves we are probably going to get there.

16
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,640
And I am still struggling with my magma dump area.

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,320
And I think that it's something to do with needing a refuse stockpile and a dumping zone

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,600
in the same tile.

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,080
You have to layer those together to get it to work.

20
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:26,080
So we're still just using garbage piles.
