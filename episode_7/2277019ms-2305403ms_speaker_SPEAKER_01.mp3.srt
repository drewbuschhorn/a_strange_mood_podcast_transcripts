1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Yeah, the way I work around all this is I've decided that my nobles will never be part of squads or else to be part

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:11,920
Of a like, you know home squad. Yeah, and then also that chief medical dwarf and bookkeeper and all those people

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,880
They're just uh, they're they're always going to be nobles as well

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,600
in older versions of dwarf fortress, I think the nobles maybe

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:27,360
Refuse to do any jobs whatsoever, but I think in this version they stopped doing like menial jobs, but skilled jobs

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,360
They'll keep doing okay
