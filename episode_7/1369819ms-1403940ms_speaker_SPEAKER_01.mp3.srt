00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,720
But also the forgotten beasts of different different sorts including titans and dragons

00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,960
Anything above a certain power level internally in the game, right?

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,320
and uh, if those drop below certain criterion you transition from

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,920
