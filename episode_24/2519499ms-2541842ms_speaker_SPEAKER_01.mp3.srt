00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
So, the overlook. The story goes that one man let his greed get the most of him.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,400
He built his theme parks with profits first and fear second.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,240
Safety wasn't a concern. All the corners cut left an avalanche of sawdust and he was buried by it.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,920
His home, his grave, the monument to profits gained and bottom

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,160
lines met. That's the old building up on the hill. That's the overlook.
