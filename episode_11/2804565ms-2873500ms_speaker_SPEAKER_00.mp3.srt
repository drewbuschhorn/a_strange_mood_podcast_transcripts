00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
Yeah, that's fair. That's fair. I have done it. It works fine. I was able to sort of,

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:14,800
grep is the term, do find, find replace through it for some different bits of information,

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:21,440
but it's definitely going to have to wait for the DFHack guys to update the Legends Mode viewer

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:27,360
software that's out there before I think it'll be super readable to people. But using that,

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,400
I was able to find out stuff about the various gods that we have going on and all that sort of

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,960
thing. And actually, it'd be pretty interesting to combine the information that comes from that

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:44,800
with the information that our Discord member wrote. Oh, yeah. Right. He wrote that little

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:53,520
script to pull out information using kind of a subsystem in DFHack online. I think the information

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,000
that he pulled out with that is actually not in the accidental export. Oh, wow. All right.

10
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,200
Or some of it is and some of it isn't from what I could see, but I need to investigate that further

11
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:23,920
and see about maybe we can merge all this information together or do something like that.
