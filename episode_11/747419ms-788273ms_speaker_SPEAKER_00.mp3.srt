1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
So after that, Azza was wounded so I thought I would go and kind of finish him off.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:16,160
So I sent all of our squads in at once and yeah, he really beat the crap out of our squads.

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:26,800
And we rapidly, before I was able to do anything to recover the situation, went from 120 people to 85 with a lot of those wounded.

4
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,000
We did eventually kill Azza, rumored Talons, but he took some killing.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:53,200
And then, as he was dead and we were hauling people back to the hospital, the fourth Forgotten Beast arrived.
