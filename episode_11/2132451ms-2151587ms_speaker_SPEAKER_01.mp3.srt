00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,060
I think that I typically will just dig straight down to a certain level and if I'm not finding

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,140
them then I will start to dig spurs in the four cardinal directions, just exploratory

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,660
mine shafts to see if we open up into the caverns.

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:31,820
And that way I have narrow passageways that I can wall off easily if I need to.
