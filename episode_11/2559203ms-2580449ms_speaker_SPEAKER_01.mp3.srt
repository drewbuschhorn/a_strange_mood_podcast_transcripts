1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
Right, like I did for all of my other forts.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,720
It was really playing the shared fort that I was like,

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,160
okay, I see how to kind of keep this safe and wall in quickly

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,600
so that we don't have what I then had.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,640
Although I was in the process of walling us in

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,320
when I unearthed that demon.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,320
So it was basically walled in with us.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,200
Yeah, you don't want that.

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:30,200
Hey, Bogert, yeah.
