There's some weird rules about that,

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,400
like if it's ever touched the outside, I think,

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,400
or if there's one square that can see the outside.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,280
So I don't know about that.

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,480
But if you set it up in sort of a closed environment

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,320
and then do the circular pump thing,

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:29,320
that might keep it moving enough.
