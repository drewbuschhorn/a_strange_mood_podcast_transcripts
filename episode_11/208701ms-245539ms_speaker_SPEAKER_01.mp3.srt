1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
Well, that might be because there weren't very many of us.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,600
So I got down to the caverns pretty quickly.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,180
Everything was looking really good. You know, I had caverns.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,480
We got there really fast. We were well-established with farming.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,600
And then there was one of those obsidian pillars in the cavern,

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,040
is in the second cavern lair. Now I've opened those up a few times and it's been fine.

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,600
I've just gotten some obsidian. This time it was not fine.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:49,560
But there was a gecko demon in there by the name of Sneaked Guys.
