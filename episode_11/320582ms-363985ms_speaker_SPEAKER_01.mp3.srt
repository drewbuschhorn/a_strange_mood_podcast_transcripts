1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
Then a blind cave ogre meandered in.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,680
And this was while I was still trying to wall

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,480
in our cavern access.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,480
And yeah, he took out all but five remaining adult dwarves

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,400
and seven children, seven.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,960
So heroic drains the blind cave ogre

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,920
just about finished off my fort.

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,200
I think this was in, it was in summer of year one.

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,040
We had no migrants.

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,240
I was pretty convinced that I was gonna lose this fort.

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,320
But why don't you give us an update to your fort?

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,800
I know that Copper Streams was,

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:01:00,800
last we saw it was thriving.
