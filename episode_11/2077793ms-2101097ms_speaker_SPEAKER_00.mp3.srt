1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
So I generally just try to get down to where I think about height-wise it should be,

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,800
though it varies wildly. Oh it does, yeah.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,560
Because it's kind of calculated at world generation, like where the layer is, and then

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,680
the rest of the world is kind of layered on top of that. Yeah.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:29,280
So especially if you're in kind of a hilly area it can be a little bit more difficult.
