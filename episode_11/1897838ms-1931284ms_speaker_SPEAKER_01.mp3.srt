00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
I did. I was going to only read the entry on caverns and then I got into exploratory

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,480
mining and then into strange moods and I was up later than I meant to be. But there are

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,800
typically three layers of caverns. I think that we've mentioned that briefly. And usually

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,240
they have a type of moss in them, which is, you know, where you grow plump helmets or

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,840
other dwarven crops. Those crops want to be grown underground. That's actually really

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,320
important. Plump helmets won't grow outside.
