1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
So now I try to

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,400
wall off every point as soon as there is access. So

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,880
even if I'm not on the cavern ground and I can see down into the cavern, flying creatures or

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,200
climbing creatures can come up that wall and enter my fort that way. So I've been walling off really carefully.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:24,940
It's also important to, if you are in the cavern at the edge of your map, to still wall off that edge of the map

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:30,040
because creatures will spawn at the edge of the map like forgotten beasts and wander in.
