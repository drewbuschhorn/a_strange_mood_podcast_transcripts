1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,360
Yeah, I think that's a really good strategy.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,400
And once you get kind of a stable location like that,

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,160
you can start to kind of expand outward and build walls

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,500
and keep yourself protected that way if you want to turtle a bit.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,260
Yeah.

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,100
And there's nothing wrong with that.

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,740
And by getting down to the magma and easy access

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,900
to the various metal ores and all that,

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,200
you can really start pumping out a lot of tradable goods

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,400
and really bring the value of your fort up

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,100
and start to get yourself in a position to become the mountain home.

12
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:32,500
Yeah.

13
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,200
And this is, you know, sort of the way the game was meant to be played.

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,800
Again, I feel bad saying this because, as we've talked about,

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:01:03,800
Dwarf Fortress.
