1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
More like Australia.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Oh, okay.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,280
Yeah, it's fairly big.

4
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,000
It's just not the size of the main continent.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I gotcha.

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yeah.

7
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,560
I was trying to think of another comparable, but I don't think it's worth the mental effort

8
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,520
since we're recording in the morning instead of the evening.

9
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,400
It's lucky I even know my name.

10
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:22,200
But it's in also a savage location, so tougher wildlife, presumably.

11
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,520
I haven't seen a lot of outdoor wildlife, I will say.

12
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,000
I've seen lots of subterranean wildlife.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I've seen lots of wildlife.
