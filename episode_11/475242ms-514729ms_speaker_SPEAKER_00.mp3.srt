Yeah, historical, about 15 years back. I think it must have been important to several of the initial seven who settled.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Oh, okay.

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That was made by Delir Gordshield, a follower of Anon. Nothing super exciting about him other than he's greedy and self-important.

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And then a 30,000 dwarf buck green glass chain called Riddlefrey, which is encrusted with point-cut almandenes and bryolite-cut green glass gems.

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That is actually sitting in Risky Calm, our open-to-all-comers general copper temple in the center of our court.

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yeah.
