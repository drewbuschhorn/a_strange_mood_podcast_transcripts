1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
just turn them off in world generation.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,480
It's something to think about,

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,200
and I do feel a little bit like it's a challenge

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,360
that I need to learn to handle,

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,640
but also like it's a game, you know?

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,720
I'm here to have fun.

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,400
Right, and if I don't wanna deal with water in that way,

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,240
then I don't have to,

9
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,860
but with the stream drying up in the winter,

10
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,940
yeah, I don't know.

11
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,820
So I'm gonna figure that out maybe.

12
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,560
The other thing that I'm gonna start doing

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,700
is building just a bunch of cage traps,

14
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,400
because I've already caught a couple

15
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,800
of other cavern creatures in those,

16
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,400
and I'm not really sure what to do with them

17
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,320
once I have them caged,

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,320
so I just sort of put them outside.

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:01:03,320
Yeah. Good luck.
