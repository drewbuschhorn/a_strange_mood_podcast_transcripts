Yeah, with that, all the furnaces and all the kilns, you can just not have to deal with

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,400
wood and making charcoal.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:13,880
Basically at all, you still have to do some ashery work in order to be able to make lye,

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,040
soap and those sorts of cleaning things.

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,040
Potash.
