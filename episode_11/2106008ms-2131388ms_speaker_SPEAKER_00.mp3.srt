1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Usually then you're digging through soil so it'll go pretty fast.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:02,900
Yes.

3
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:07,400
But I generally just cut out in a straight line,

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,000
you know, like from four corners or something like that.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,500
Yeah.

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,000
You know, the four compass rows or something like that,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and dig in a straight line until we break out into something.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,500
Yeah.

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,800
And then after some period of time, if we haven't hit anything,

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,500
I dig, you know, go down another 20 Z levels and try again.
