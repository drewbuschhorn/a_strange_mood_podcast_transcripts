00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
in. Jump right in. Well, um, let me tell you a little about my new fort. I think I talked about

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,560
it a tiny bit, mostly that it existed when we talked about our shared fort, Grovinks,

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:18,640
but this one is called Bellblade. Ooh. Bellblade. It's, um, it's cool. It's, um,

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,520
I just, I managed to pick a really great location by accident and I, like, tunneled directly into

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,920
a hill from two sides and we have a stream that I was going to make a waterfall, but it turns out

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,880
the stream dries up in the winter. Oh yeah. Yeah. So I'm going to have to figure that out. But, um,

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,120
I started that and chose a location on an island continent. So we are on,

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:57,200
um, across an ocean from our civilization.
