1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
When I checked on it today, she was out of the hospital.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:11,780
She was there a lot longer than our militia commander whose hand had like exploded.

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,920
And she, the child, had had crushed ribs, I think, so she just needed longer in the

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,920
hospital.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,980
But when our migrants showed up, there were a couple of proficient doctors.

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,940
So now we have a chief medical dwarf, a bone doctor, and a surgeon.

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:33,460
So they treated both the child and the militia commander, and both of them have now been

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,740
released from the hospital.

9
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,740
Doing pretty well.

10
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:44,820
I'm going to keep an eye on those, the four adults, as well as the child who was left

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,900
for dead.

12
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,460
So we have the angry militia commander who is azoom glaze inches.

13
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,440
She is in the 7 out of 7 dreadful mood.

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,580
She is extremely angry.

15
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,980
She's not in the hospital anymore.

16
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,980
I retired her from being militia commander while she was so injured.

17
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,420
I'm not sure what to do with her now.

18
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,260
I'd rather not have to banish her because I would like to hang on to those original

19
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,640
four dwarves.

20
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,260
So I'm going to look into her interests and stuff and see if we can't cheer her up.

21
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:30,100
We have logam tongue spear.
