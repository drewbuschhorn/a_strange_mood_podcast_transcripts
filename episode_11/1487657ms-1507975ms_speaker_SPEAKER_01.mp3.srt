1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Oh, see, that would be nice.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Yeah.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Yeah.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So I need to figure out...

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Elemental.

6
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hmm.

7
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,120
I need to figure out, other than defenses, what else I'm going to do.

8
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,560
We've had a couple of fun new-to-me creatures.

9
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,140
We have a pond grabber, a small creature that lives in watery ditches deep underground.

10
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:33,180
It has a sharp beak and four tentacles with claws at the end.
