1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Well, let's take a minute and talk about that, because I was also left with a bad situation

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,220
with my five dwarves and seven children.

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:15,320
So I actually turned to our listeners in the Discord and got some good advice, and I really

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,440
didn't want to give up this fort and was like, if I lose it, I'm still going to go reclaim

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,040
it because I really like this location.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:27,400
So I went through and turned off all the work orders, except I think...

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,080
We had a lot of drinks, we had a lot of food, so I didn't even have a work order going there.

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,920
I think I might have left gem cutting going because we have a legendary gem cutter, and

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,640
I was like, well, eventually we will get a merchant and I can spend gems and get some

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,640
migrants.

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,000
And it went pretty well, actually.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,920
I also made sure to finish walling off our caverns so that nothing else could come in,

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:01,000
because at some point we did have two giant olms wander in as I was walling us off, and

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,840
nothing really bad happened.

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,440
They did eventually kill them, but somehow in that, in the walling off, we lost another

16
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,720
expedition leader.

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,840
I have no idea how he died.

18
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,080
I'm assuming he must have gotten walled out or was secretly killed by a giant olm, but

19
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,960
I think I would have gotten a notification about that.

20
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,580
I just got the pop-up that he had been missing for a week.

21
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,440
And then we were on to our third expedition leader.

22
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,760
So I kind of just let the fort run for a while.

23
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,760
We eventually did get merchants.

24
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,760
They didn't have very much good stuff, but I just bought all of it in the hopes of getting

25
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:53,040
some migrants.
