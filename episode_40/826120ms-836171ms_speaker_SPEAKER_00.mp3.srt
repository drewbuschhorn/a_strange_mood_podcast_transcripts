00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Wow, that's an interesting crafting material.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:03,860
Yeah.

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,440
Because they're like humanoid.

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,200
Are they not?

5
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,880
Are they monsters in Dwarf Fortress?

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,280
I've never encountered one.
