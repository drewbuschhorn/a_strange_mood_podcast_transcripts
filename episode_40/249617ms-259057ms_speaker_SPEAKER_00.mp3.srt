1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
and I've been kind of collecting them.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,400
I think the guide for Animal Crossing

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,400
was the first one that you got for me.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,040
And after that, I got the sturdy one

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,600
and I'm very excited to get one for Dwarf Fortress.
