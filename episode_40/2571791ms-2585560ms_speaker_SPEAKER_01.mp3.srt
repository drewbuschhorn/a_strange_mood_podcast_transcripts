Yeah, the UI is tough.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,800
It's very much in that sort of roll your own UI

00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,840

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,680
Oh, really?

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,040
Where they're not following the sort of conventions

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:13,880
that we do.
