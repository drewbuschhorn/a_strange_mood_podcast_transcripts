It sure looks like he's riding a unicorn there. I'm nowhere near being able to do that, but, um,

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,840
and you can, like, it's supposed to be sims-like in its interactions with the villagers, but

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,880
best I can tell they seem really shallow. If it were an early access game, I would say this is

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,559
really cool, like, I can't wait to see where this is going. Technically, this is a 1.0,

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,639
and it's pretty buggy, and, like, some of the language isn't great. I've still played a couple

6
00:00:28,639 --> 00:00:34,720
hours of it, like, I'm enjoying it, so I'm definitely gonna keep it, keep aware of it,

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,000
just to see where they go with it.
